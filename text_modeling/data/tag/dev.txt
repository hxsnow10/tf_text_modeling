design technology creativity	i have a friend in portugal whose grandfather built a vehicle out of a bicycle and a washing machine so he could transport his family . he did it because he could n't afford a car , but also because he knew how to build one . there was a time when we understood how things worked and how they were made , so we could build and repair them , or at the very least make informed decisions about what to buy . many of these do - it - yourself practices were lost in the second half of the 20th century . but now , the maker community and the open - source model are bringing this kind of knowledge about how things work and what they 're made of back into our lives , and i believe we need to take them to the next level , to the components things are made of . for the most part , we still know what traditional materials like paper and textiles are made of and how they are produced . but now we have these amazing , futuristic composites -- plastics that change shape , paints that conduct electricity , pigments that change color , fabrics that light up . let me show you some examples . so conductive ink allows us to paint circuits instead of using the traditional printed circuit boards or wires . in the case of this little example i 'm holding , we used it to create a touch sensor that reacts to my skin by turning on this little light . conductive ink has been used by artists , but recent developments indicate that we will soon be able to use it in laser printers and pens . and this is a sheet of acrylic infused with colorless light - diffusing particles . what this means is that , while regular acrylic only diffuses light around the edges , this one illuminates across the entire surface when i turn on the lights around it . two of the known applications for this material include interior design and multi - touch systems . and thermochromic pigments change color at a given temperature . so i 'm going to place this on a hot plate that is set to a temperature only slightly higher than ambient and you can see what happens . so one of the principle applications for this material is , amongst other things , in baby bottles , so it indicates when the contents are cool enough to drink . so these are just a few of what are commonly known as smart materials . in a few years , they will be in many of the objects and technologies we use on a daily basis . we may not yet have the flying cars science fiction promised us , but we can have walls that change color depending on temperature , keyboards that roll up , and windows that become opaque at the flick of a switch . so i 'm a social scientist by training , so why am i here today talking about smart materials ? well first of all , because i am a maker . i 'm curious about how things work and how they are made , but also because i believe we should have a deeper understanding of the components that make up our world , and right now , we do n't know enough about these high - tech composites our future will be made of . smart materials are hard to obtain in small quantities . there 's barely any information available on how to use them , and very little is said about how they are produced . so for now , they exist mostly in this realm of trade secrets and patents only universities and corporations have access to . so a little over three years ago , kirsty boyle and i started a project we called open materials . it 's a website where we , and anyone else who wants to join us , share experiments , publish information , encourage others to contribute whenever they can , and aggregate resources such as research papers and tutorials by other makers like ourselves . we would like it to become a large , collectively generated database of do - it - yourself information on smart materials . but why should we care how smart materials work and what they are made of ? first of all , because we ca n't shape what we do n't understand , and what we do n't understand and use ends up shaping us . the objects we use , the clothes we wear , the houses we live in , all have a profound impact on our behavior , health and quality of life . so if we are to live in a world made of smart materials , we should know and understand them . secondly , and just as important , innovation has always been fueled by tinkerers . so many times , amateurs , not experts , have been the inventors and improvers of things ranging from mountain bikes to semiconductors , personal computers , airplanes . the biggest challenge is that material science is complex and requires expensive equipment . but that 's not always the case . two scientists at university of illinois understood this when they published a paper on a simpler method for making conductive ink . jordan bunker , who had had no experience with chemistry until then , read this paper and reproduced the experiment at his maker space using only off - the - shelf substances and tools . he used a toaster oven , and he even made his own vortex mixer , based on a tutorial by another scientist / maker . jordan then published his results online , including all the things he had tried and did n't work , so others could study and reproduce it . so jordan 's main form of innovation was to take an experiment created in a well - equipped lab at the university and recreate it in a garage in chicago using only cheap materials and tools he made himself . and now that he published this work , others can pick up where he left and devise even simpler processes and improvements . another example i 'd like to mention is hannah perner - wilson 's kit - of - no - parts . her project 's goal is to highlight the expressive qualities of materials while focusing on the creativity and skills of the builder . electronics kits are very powerful in that they teach us how things work , but the constraints inherent in their design influence the way we learn . so hannah 's approach , on the other hand , is to formulate a series of techniques for creating unusual objects that free us from pre - designed constraints by teaching us about the materials themselves . so amongst hannah 's many impressive experiments , this is one of my favorites . [ " paper speakers " ] what we 're seeing here is just a piece of paper with some copper tape on it connected to an mp3 player and a magnet . so based on the research by marcelo coelho from mit , hannah created a series of paper speakers out of a wide range of materials from simple copper tape to conductive fabric and ink . just like jordan and so many other makers , hannah published her recipes and allows anyone to copy and reproduce them . but paper electronics is one of the most promising branches of material science in that it allows us to create cheaper and flexible electronics . so hannah 's artisanal work , and the fact that she shared her findings , opens the doors to a series of new possibilities that are both aesthetically appealing and innovative . so the interesting thing about makers is that we create out of passion and curiosity , and we are not afraid to fail . we often tackle problems from unconventional angles , and , in the process , end up discovering alternatives or even better ways to do things . so the more people experiment with materials , the more researchers are willing to share their research , and manufacturers their knowledge , the better chances we have to create technologies that truly serve us all . so i feel a bit as ted nelson must have when , in the early 1970s , he wrote , " you must understand computers now . " back then , computers were these large mainframes only scientists cared about , and no one dreamed of even having one at home . so it 's a little strange that i 'm standing here and saying , " you must understand smart materials now . " just keep in mind that acquiring preemptive knowledge about emerging technologies is the best way to ensure that we have a say in the making of our future . thank you .
culture	i was one of the only kids in college who had a reason to go to the p.o. box at the end of the day , and that was mainly because my mother has never believed in email , in facebook , in texting or cell phones in general . and so while other kids were bbm - ing their parents , i was literally waiting by the mailbox to get a letter from home to see how the weekend had gone , which was a little frustrating when grandma was in the hospital , but i was just looking for some sort of scribble , some unkempt cursive from my mother . and so when i moved to new york city after college and got completely sucker - punched in the face by depression , i did the only thing i could think of at the time . i wrote those same kinds of letters that my mother had written me for strangers , and tucked them all throughout the city , dozens and dozens of them . i left them everywhere , in cafes and in libraries , at the u.n. , everywhere . i blogged about those letters and the days when they were necessary , and i posed a kind of crazy promise to the internet : that if you asked me for a hand - written letter , i would write you one , no questions asked . overnight , my inbox morphed into this harbor of heartbreak -- a single mother in sacramento , a girl being bullied in rural kansas , all asking me , a 22 - year - old girl who barely even knew her own coffee order , to write them a love letter and give them a reason to wait by the mailbox . well , today i fuel a global organization that is fueled by those trips to the mailbox , fueled by the ways in which we can harness social media like never before to write and mail strangers letters when they need them most , but most of all , fueled by crates of mail like this one , my trusty mail crate , filled with the scriptings of ordinary people , strangers writing letters to other strangers not because they 're ever going to meet and laugh over a cup of coffee , but because they have found one another by way of letter - writing . but , you know , the thing that always gets me about these letters is that most of them have been written by people that have never known themselves loved on a piece of paper . they could not tell you about the ink of their own love letters . they 're the ones from my generation , the ones of us that have grown up into a world where everything is paperless , and where some of our best conversations have happened upon a screen . we have learned to diary our pain onto facebook , and we speak swiftly in 140 characters or less . but what if it 's not about efficiency this time ? i was on the subway yesterday with this mail crate , which is a conversation starter , let me tell you . if you ever need one , just carry one of these . and a man just stared at me , and he was like , " well , why do n't you use the internet ? " and i thought , " well , sir , i am not a strategist , nor am i specialist . i am merely a storyteller . " and so i could tell you about a woman whose husband has just come home from afghanistan , and she is having a hard time unearthing this thing called conversation , and so she tucks love letters throughout the house as a way to say , " come back to me . find me when you can . " or a girl who decides that she is going to leave love letters around her campus in dubuque , iowa , only to find her efforts ripple - effected the next day when she walks out onto the quad and finds love letters hanging from the trees , tucked in the bushes and the benches . or the man who decides that he is going to take his life , uses facebook as a way to say goodbye to friends and family . well , tonight he sleeps safely with a stack of letters just like this one tucked beneath his pillow , scripted by strangers who were there for him when . these are the kinds of stories that convinced me that letter - writing will never again need to flip back her hair and talk about efficiency , because she is an art form now , all the parts of her , the signing , the scripting , the mailing , the doodles in the margins . the mere fact that somebody would even just sit down , pull out a piece of paper and think about someone the whole way through , with an intention that is so much harder to unearth when the browser is up and the iphone is pinging and we 've got six conversations rolling in at once , that is an art form that does not fall down to the goliath of " get faster , " no matter how many social networks we might join . we still clutch close these letters to our chest , to the words that speak louder than loud , when we turn pages into palettes to say the things that we have needed to say , the words that we have needed to write , to sisters and brothers and even to strangers , for far too long . thank you .
technology	i 'd like to tell you about two games of chess . the first happened in 1997 , in which garry kasparov , a human , lost to deep blue , a machine . to many , this was the dawn of a new era , one where man would be dominated by machine . but here we are , 20 years on , and the greatest change in how we relate to computers is the ipad , not hal . the second game was a freestyle chess tournament in 2005 , in which man and machine could enter together as partners , rather than adversaries , if they so chose . at first , the results were predictable . even a supercomputer was beaten by a grandmaster with a relatively weak laptop . the surprise came at the end . who won ? not a grandmaster with a supercomputer , but actually two american amateurs using three relatively weak laptops . their ability to coach and manipulate their computers to deeply explore specific positions effectively counteracted the superior chess knowledge of the grandmasters and the superior computational power of other adversaries . this is an astonishing result : average men , average machines beating the best man , the best machine . and anyways , is n't it supposed to be man versus machine ? instead , it 's about cooperation , and the right type of cooperation . we 've been paying a lot of attention to marvin minsky 's vision for artificial intelligence over the last 50 years . it 's a sexy vision , for sure . many have embraced it . it 's become the dominant school of thought in computer science . but as we enter the era of big data , of network systems , of open platforms , and embedded technology , i 'd like to suggest it 's time to reevaluate an alternative vision that was actually developed around the same time . i 'm talking about j.c.r. licklider 's human - computer symbiosis , perhaps better termed " intelligence augmentation , " i.a. licklider was a computer science titan who had a profound effect on the development of technology and the internet . his vision was to enable man and machine to cooperate in making decisions , controlling complex situations without the inflexible dependence on predetermined programs . note that word " cooperate . " licklider encourages us not to take a toaster and make it data from " star trek , " but to take a human and make her more capable . humans are so amazing -- how we think , our non - linear approaches , our creativity , iterative hypotheses , all very difficult if possible at all for computers to do . licklider intuitively realized this , contemplating humans setting the goals , formulating the hypotheses , determining the criteria , and performing the evaluation . of course , in other ways , humans are so limited . we 're terrible at scale , computation and volume . we require high - end talent management to keep the rock band together and playing . licklider foresaw computers doing all the routinizable work that was required to prepare the way for insights and decision making . silently , without much fanfare , this approach has been compiling victories beyond chess . protein folding , a topic that shares the incredible expansiveness of chess -- there are more ways of folding a protein than there are atoms in the universe . this is a world - changing problem with huge implications for our ability to understand and treat disease . and for this task , supercomputer field brute force simply is n't enough . foldit , a game created by computer scientists , illustrates the value of the approach . non - technical , non - biologist amateurs play a video game in which they visually rearrange the structure of the protein , allowing the computer to manage the atomic forces and interactions and identify structural issues . this approach beat supercomputers 50 percent of the time and tied 30 percent of the time . foldit recently made a notable and major scientific discovery by deciphering the structure of the mason - pfizer monkey virus . a protease that had eluded determination for over 10 years was solved was by three players in a matter of days , perhaps the first major scientific advance to come from playing a video game . last year , on the site of the twin towers , the 9/11 memorial opened . it displays the names of the thousands of victims using a beautiful concept called " meaningful adjacency . " it places the names next to each other based on their relationships to one another : friends , families , coworkers . when you put it all together , it 's quite a computational challenge : 3,500 victims , 1,800 adjacency requests , the importance of the overall physical specifications and the final aesthetics . when first reported by the media , full credit for such a feat was given to an algorithm from the new york city design firm local projects . the truth is a bit more nuanced . while an algorithm was used to develop the underlying framework , humans used that framework to design the final result . so in this case , a computer had evaluated millions of possible layouts , managed a complex relational system , and kept track of a very large set of measurements and variables , allowing the humans to focus on design and compositional choices . so the more you look around you , the more you see licklider 's vision everywhere . whether it 's augmented reality in your iphone or gps in your car , human - computer symbiosis is making us more capable . so if you want to improve human - computer symbiosis , what can you do ? you can start by designing the human into the process . instead of thinking about what a computer will do to solve the problem , design the solution around what the human will do as well . when you do this , you 'll quickly realize that you spent all of your time on the interface between man and machine , specifically on designing away the friction in the interaction . in fact , this friction is more important than the power of the man or the power of the machine in determining overall capability . that 's why two amateurs with a few laptops handily beat a supercomputer and a grandmaster . what kasparov calls process is a byproduct of friction . the better the process , the less the friction . and minimizing friction turns out to be the decisive variable . or take another example : big data . every interaction we have in the world is recorded by an ever growing array of sensors : your phone , your credit card , your computer . the result is big data , and it actually presents us with an opportunity to more deeply understand the human condition . the major emphasis of most approaches to big data focus on , " how do i store this data ? how do i search this data ? how do i process this data ? " these are necessary but insufficient questions . the imperative is not to figure out how to compute , but what to compute . how do you impose human intuition on data at this scale ? again , we start by designing the human into the process . when paypal was first starting as a business , their biggest challenge was not , " how do i send money back and forth online ? " it was , " how do i do that without being defrauded by organized crime ? " why so challenging ? because while computers can learn to detect and identify fraud based on patterns , they ca n't learn to do that based on patterns they 've never seen before , and organized crime has a lot in common with this audience : brilliant people , relentlessly resourceful , entrepreneurial spirit -- -- and one huge and important difference : purpose . and so while computers alone can catch all but the cleverest fraudsters , catching the cleverest is the difference between success and failure . there 's a whole class of problems like this , ones with adaptive adversaries . they rarely if ever present with a repeatable pattern that 's discernable to computers . instead , there 's some inherent component of innovation or disruption , and increasingly these problems are buried in big data . for example , terrorism . terrorists are always adapting in minor and major ways to new circumstances , and despite what you might see on tv , these adaptations , and the detection of them , are fundamentally human . computers do n't detect novel patterns and new behaviors , but humans do . humans , using technology , testing hypotheses , searching for insight by asking machines to do things for them . osama bin laden was not caught by artificial intelligence . he was caught by dedicated , resourceful , brilliant people in partnerships with various technologies . as appealing as it might sound , you cannot algorithmically data mine your way to the answer . there is no " find terrorist " button , and the more data we integrate from a vast variety of sources across a wide variety of data formats from very disparate systems , the less effective data mining can be . instead , people will have to look at data and search for insight , and as licklider foresaw long ago , the key to great results here is the right type of cooperation , and as kasparov realized , that means minimizing friction at the interface . now this approach makes possible things like combing through all available data from very different sources , identifying key relationships and putting them in one place , something that 's been nearly impossible to do before . to some , this has terrifying privacy and civil liberties implications . to others it foretells of an era of greater privacy and civil liberties protections , but privacy and civil liberties are of fundamental importance . that must be acknowledged , and they ca n't be swept aside , even with the best of intents . so let 's explore , through a couple of examples , the impact that technologies built to drive human - computer symbiosis have had in recent time . in october , 2007 , u.s. and coalition forces raided an al qaeda safe house in the city of sinjar on the syrian border of iraq . they found a treasure trove of documents : 700 biographical sketches of foreign fighters . these foreign fighters had left their families in the gulf , the levant and north africa to join al qaeda in iraq . these records were human resource forms . the foreign fighters filled them out as they joined the organization . it turns out that al qaeda , too , is not without its bureaucracy . they answered questions like , " who recruited you ? " " what 's your hometown ? " " what occupation do you seek ? " in that last question , a surprising insight was revealed . the vast majority of foreign fighters were seeking to become suicide bombers for martyrdom -- hugely important , since between 2003 and 2007 , iraq had 1,382 suicide bombings , a major source of instability . analyzing this data was hard . the originals were sheets of paper in arabic that had to be scanned and translated . the friction in the process did not allow for meaningful results in an operational time frame using humans , pdfs the researchers had to lever up their human minds with technology to dive deeper , to explore non - obvious hypotheses , and in fact , insights emerged . twenty percent of the foreign fighters were from libya , 50 percent of those from a single town in libya , hugely important since prior statistics put that figure at three percent . it also helped to hone in on a figure of rising importance in al qaeda , abu yahya al-libi , a senior cleric in the libyan islamic fighting group . in march of 2007 , he gave a speech , after which there was a surge in participation amongst libyan foreign fighters . perhaps most clever of all , though , and least obvious , by flipping the data on its head , the researchers were able to deeply explore the coordination networks in syria that were ultimately responsible for receiving and transporting the foreign fighters to the border . these were networks of mercenaries , not ideologues , who were in the coordination business for profit . for example , they charged saudi foreign fighters substantially more than libyans , money that would have otherwise gone to al qaeda . perhaps the adversary would disrupt their own network if they knew they cheating would - be jihadists . in january , 2010 , a devastating 7.0 earthquake struck haiti , third deadliest earthquake of all time , left one million people , 10 percent of the population , homeless . one seemingly small aspect of the overall relief effort became increasingly important as the delivery of food and water started rolling . january and february are the dry months in haiti , yet many of the camps had developed standing water . the only institution with detailed knowledge of haiti 's floodplains had been leveled in the earthquake , leadership inside . so the question is , which camps are at risk , how many people are in these camps , what 's the timeline for flooding , and given very limited resources and infrastructure , how do we prioritize the relocation ? the data was incredibly disparate . the u.s. army had detailed knowledge for only a small section of the country . there was data online from a 2006 environmental risk conference , other geospatial data , none of it integrated . the human goal here was to identify camps for relocation based on priority need . the computer had to integrate a vast amount of geospacial information , social media data and relief organization information to answer this question . by implementing a superior process , what was otherwise a task for 40 people over three months became a simple job for three people in 40 hours , all victories for human - computer symbiosis . we 're more than 50 years into licklider 's vision for the future , and the data suggests that we should be quite excited about tackling this century 's hardest problems , man and machine in cooperation together . thank you .
culture	newscaster : there 's a large path of destruction here in town . ... hit here pulling trees from the ground , shattering windows , taking the roofs off of homes . caitria o'neill : that was me in front of our house in monson , massachusetts last june . after an ef 3 tornado ripped straight through our town and took parts of our roof off , i decided to stay in massachusetts instead of pursuing the master 's program i had moved my boxes home that afternoon for . morgan o'neill : so , on june 1st we were n't disaster experts , but on june 3rd we started faking it . this experience changed our lives . and now we 're trying to change the experience . co : so tornadoes do n't happen in massachusetts . and i was cleverly standing in the front yard when one came over the hill . after a lamppost flew by , my family and i sprinted into the basement . trees were thrown against the house , the windows exploded . when we finally got out the back door , transformers were burning in the street . mo : so i was here in boston . i 'm a phd student at mit , and i happen to study atmospheric science . actually it gets weirder . so i was in the museum of science at the time the tornado hit , playing with the tornado display . so i missed her call . so i get the call from caitria , i hear the news , and i start tracking the radar online to call the family back when another supercell was forming in their area . and i drove home late that night with batteries and ice . we live across the street from an historic church that had lost its very iconic steeple in the storm . it had become a community gathering place overnight . the town hall and the police department had also suffered direct hits , and so people wanting to help or needing information went to the church . co : we walked up to the church because we heard that they had hot meals , but when we arrived we found problems . there were a couple large , sweaty men with chainsaws standing in the center of the church , but nobody knew where to send them because no one knew the extent of the damage yet . and as we watched , they became frustrated and left to go find somebody to help on their own . mo : so we started organizing . why ? it had to be done . we found pastor bob and offered to give the response some infrastructure . and then armed with just two laptops and one aircard , we built a recovery machine . co : that was a tornado , and everyone 's heading to the church to drop things off and volunteer . mo : everyone 's donating clothing . we should really inventory the donations that are piling up here . co : yeah , and we need a hotline . can you make a google voice number ? mo : yeah , sure . and we need to tell people what not to bring . i 'll make a facebook account . can you print fliers for the neighborhoods ? co : yeah , but we do n't even know what houses are accepting help at this point . we need to canvas and send out volunteers . mo : we need to tell people what not to bring . hey , there 's a news truck . i 'll tell them . co : you got my number off the news ? we do n't need any more freezers . mo : the insurance wo n't cover it ? you need a crew to tar your roof ? co : six packs of juice boxes arriving in one hour ? together : someone get me post - its ! co : and then the rest of the community figured out that we had answers . mo : i can donate three water heaters , but someone needs to come pick them up . co : my car is in my living room . mo : my boyscout troop would like to rebuild 12 mailboxes . co : the puppy 's missing , and insurance just does n't cover the chimneys . mo : my church group of 50 would like housing and meals for a week while we repair properties . co : you sent me to that place on washington street yesterday , and now i 'm covered in poison ivy . so this is what filled our days . we had to learn how to answer questions quickly and to solve problems in about a minute or less , because otherwise something more urgent would come up , and it just would n't get done . mo : we did n't get our authority from the board of selectmen or the emergency management director or the united way . we just started answering questions and making decisions because someone , anyone , had to . and why not me ? i 'm a campaign organizer . i 'm good at facebook . and there 's two of me . co : the point is , if there 's a flood or a fire or a hurricane , you , or somebody like you , are going to step up and start organizing things . the other point is that it is hard . mo : lying on the ground after another 17 - hour day , caitria and i would empty our pockets and try to place dozens of scraps of paper into context -- all bits of information that had to be remembered and matched in order to help someone . after another day and a shower at the shelter , we realized it should n't be this hard . co : in a country like ours where we breathe wi - fi , leveraging technology for a faster recovery should be a no - brainer . systems like the ones that we were creating on the fly could exist ahead of time . and if some community member is in this organizing position in every area after every disaster , these tools should exist . mo : so we decided to build them -- a recovery in a box , something that could be deployed after every disaster by any local organizer . co : i decided to stay in the country , give up the master 's in moscow and to work full - time to make this happen . in the course of the past year , we 've become experts in the field of community - powered disaster recovery . and there are three main problems that we 've observed with the way things work currently . mo : the tools . large aid organizations are exceptional at bringing massive resources to bear after a disaster , but they often fulfill very specific missions and then they leave . this leaves local residents to deal with the thousands of spontaneous volunteers , thousands of donations , and all with no training and no tools . so they use post - its or excel or facebook . but none of these tools allow you to value high - priority information amidst all of the photos and well wishes . co : the timing . disaster relief is essentially a backwards political campaign . in a political campaign , you start with no interest and no capacity to turn that into action . you build both gradually until a moment of peak mobilization at the time of the election . in a disaster , however , you start with all of the interest and none of the capacity . and you 've only got about seven days to capture 50 percent of all of the web searches that will ever be made to help your area . then some sporting event happens , and you 've got only the resources that you 've collected thus far to meet the next five years of recovery needs . this is the slide for katrina . this is the curve for joplin . and this is the curve for the dallas tornadoes in april where we deployed software . there 's a gap here . affected households have to wait for the insurance adjuster to visit before they can start accepting help on their properties . and you 've only got about four days of interest in dallas . mo : data . data is inherently unsexy , but it can jumpstart an area 's recovery . fema and the state will pay 85 percent of the cost of a federally declared disaster , leaving the town to pay last 15 percent of the bill . now that expense can be huge , but if the town can mobilize x amount of volunteers for y hours , the dollar value of that labor used goes toward the town 's contribution . but who knows that ? now try to imagine the sinking feeling you get when you 've just sent out 2,000 volunteers and you ca n't prove it . co : these are three problems with a common solution . if we can get the right tools at the right time to the people who will inevitably step up and start putting their communities back together , we can create new standards in disaster recovery . mo : we needed canvasing tools , donations databasing , needs reporting , remote volunteer access , all in an easy - to - use website . co : and we needed help . alvin , our software engineer and cofounder , has built these tools . chris and bill have volunteered their time to use operations and partnerships . and we 've been flying into disaster areas since this past january , setting up software , training residents and licensing the software to areas that are preparing for disasters . mo : one of our first launches was after the dallas tornadoes this past april . we flew into a town that had a static outdated website and a frenetic facebook feed trying to structure the response . and we launched our platform . all of the interest came in the first four days , but by the time they lost the news cycle , that 's when the needs came in , yet they had this massive resource of what people were able to give and they 've been able to meet the needs of their residents . co : so it 's working , but it could be better . emergency preparedness is a big deal in disaster recovery because it makes towns safer and more resilient . imagine if we could have these systems ready to go in a place before a disaster . so that 's what we 're working on . we 're working on getting the software to places so people expect it , so people know how to use it and so it can be filled ahead of time with that microinformation that drives recovery . mo : it 's not rocket science . these tools are obvious and people want them . in our hometown , we trained a half - dozen residents to run these web tools on their own . because caitria and i live here in boston . they took to it immediately , and now they are forces of nature . there are over three volunteer groups working almost every day , and have been since june 1st of last year , to make sure that these residents get what they need and get back in their homes . they have hotlines and spreadsheets and data . co : and that makes a difference . june 1st this year marked the one - year anniversary of the monson tornado . and our community 's never been more connected or more empowered . we 've been able to see the same transformation in texas and in alabama . because it does n't take harvard or mit to fly in and fix problems after a disaster , it takes a local . no matter how good an aid organization is at what they do , they eventually have to go home . but if you give locals the tools , if you show them what they can do to recover , they become experts . mo : all right . let 's go .
science biology design	everything is covered in invisible ecosystems made of tiny lifeforms : bacteria , viruses and fungi . our desks , our computers , our pencils , our buildings all harbor resident microbial landscapes . as we design these things , we could be thinking about designing these invisible worlds , and also thinking about how they interact with our personal ecosystems . our bodies are home to trillions of microbes , and these creatures define who we are . the microbes in your gut can influence your weight and your moods . the microbes on your skin can help boost your immune system . the microbes in your mouth can freshen your breath , or not , and the key thing is that our personal ecosystems interact with ecosystems on everything we touch . so , for example , when you touch a pencil , microbial exchange happens . if we can design the invisible ecosystems in our surroundings , this opens a path to influencing our health in unprecedented ways . i get asked all of the time from people , " is it possible to really design microbial ecosystems ? " and i believe the answer is yes . i think we 're doing it right now , but we 're doing it unconsciously . i 'm going to share data with you from one aspect of my research focused on architecture that demonstrates how , through both conscious and unconscious design , we 're impacting these invisible worlds . this is the lillis business complex at the university of oregon , and i worked with a team of architects and biologists to sample over 300 rooms in this building . we wanted to get something like a fossil record of the building , and to do this , we sampled dust . from the dust , we pulled out bacterial cells , broke them open , and compared their gene sequences . this means that people in my group were doing a lot of vacuuming during this project . this is a picture of tim , who , right when i snapped this picture , reminded me , he said , " jessica , the last lab group i worked in i was doing fieldwork in the costa rican rainforest , and things have changed dramatically for me . " so i 'm going to show you now first what we found in the offices , and we 're going to look at the data through a visualization tool that i 've been working on in partnership with autodesk . the way that you look at this data is , first , look around the outside of the circle . you 'll see broad bacterial groups , and if you look at the shape of this pink lobe , it tells you something about the relative abundance of each group . so at 12 o'clock , you 'll see that offices have a lot of alphaproteobacteria , and at one o'clock you 'll see that bacilli are relatively rare . let 's take a look at what 's going on in different space types in this building . if you look inside the restrooms , they all have really similar ecosystems , and if you were to look inside the classrooms , those also have similar ecosystems . but if you look across these space types , you can see that they 're fundamentally different from one another . i like to think of bathrooms like a tropical rainforest . i told tim , " if you could just see the microbes , it 's kind of like being in costa rica . kind of . " and i also like to think of offices as being a temperate grassland . this perspective is a really powerful one for designers , because you can bring on principles of ecology , and a really important principle of ecology is dispersal , the way organisms move around . we know that microbes are dispersed around by people and by air . so the very first thing we wanted to do in this building was look at the air system . mechanical engineers design air handling units to make sure that people are comfortable , that the air flow and temperature is just right . they do this using principles of physics and chemistry , but they could also be using biology . if you look at the microbes in one of the air handling units in this building , you 'll see that they 're all very similar to one another . and if you compare this to the microbes in a different air handling unit , you 'll see that they 're fundamentally different . the rooms in this building are like islands in an archipelago , and what that means is that mechanical engineers are like eco - engineers , and they have the ability to structure biomes in this building the way that they want to . another facet of how microbes get around is by people , and designers often cluster rooms together to facilitate interactions among people , or the sharing of ideas , like in labs and in offices . given that microbes travel around with people , you might expect to see rooms that are close together have really similar biomes . and that is exactly what we found . if you look at classrooms right adjacent to one another , they have very similar ecosystems , but if you go to an office that is a farther walking distance away , the ecosystem is fundamentally different . and when i see the power that dispersal has on these biogeographic patterns , it makes me think that it 's possible to tackle really challenging problems , like hospital - acquired infections . i believe this has got to be , in part , a building ecology problem . all right , i 'm going to tell you one more story about this building . i am collaborating with charlie brown . he 's an architect , and charlie is deeply concerned about global climate change . he 's dedicated his life to sustainable design . when he met me and realized that it was possible for him to study in a quantitative way how his design choices impacted the ecology and biology of this building , he got really excited , because it added a new dimension to what he did . he went from thinking just about energy to also starting to think about human health . he helped design some of the air handling systems in this building and the way it was ventilated . so what i 'm first going to show you is air that we sampled outside of the building . what you 're looking at is a signature of bacterial communities in the outdoor air , and how they vary over time . next i 'm going to show you what happened when we experimentally manipulated classrooms . we blocked them off at night so that they got no ventilation . a lot of buildings are operated this way , probably where you work , and companies do this to save money on their energy bill . what we found is that these rooms remained relatively stagnant until saturday , when we opened the vents up again . when you walked into those rooms , they smelled really bad , and our data suggests that it had something to do with leaving behind the airborne bacterial soup from people the day before . contrast this to rooms that were designed using a sustainable passive design strategy where air came in from the outside through louvers . in these rooms , the air tracked the outdoor air relatively well , and when charlie saw this , he got really excited . he felt like he had made a good choice with the design process because it was both energy efficient and it washed away the building 's resident microbial landscape . the examples that i just gave you are about architecture , but they 're relevant to the design of anything . imagine designing with the kinds of microbes that we want in a plane or on a phone . there 's a new microbe , i just discovered it . it 's called blis , and it 's been shown to both ward off pathogens and give you good breath . would n't it be awesome if we all had blis on our phones ? a conscious approach to design , i 'm calling it bioinformed design , and i think it 's possible . thank you .
science technology design	so would n't it be amazing if our phones could see the world in the same way that we do , as we 're walking around being able to point a phone at anything , and then have it actually recognize images and objects like the human brain , and then be able to pull in information from an almost infinite library of knowledge and experiences and ideas . well , traditionally that was seen as science fiction , but now we 've moved to a world where actually this has become possible . so the best way of explaining it is to just show it . what you can see over here is tamara , who is holding my phone that 's now plugged in . so let me start with this . what we have here is a painting of the great poet rabbie burns , and it 's just a normal image , but if we now switch inputs over to the phone , running our technology , you can see effectively what tamara 's seeing on the screen , and when she points at this image , something magical happens . voice : now simmer blinks on flowery braes ... matt mills : now , what 's great about this is , there 's no trickery here . there 's nothing done to this image . and what 's great about this is the technology 's actually allowing the phone to start to see and understand much like how the human brain does . not only that , but as i move the object around , it 's going to track it and overlay that content seamlessly . again , the thing that 's incredible about this is this is how advanced these devices have become . all the processing to do that was actually done on the device itself . now , this has applications everywhere , whether in things like art in museums , like you just saw , or in the world of , say , advertising , or print journalism . so a newspaper becomes out of date as soon as it 's printed . and here is this morning 's newspaper , and we have some wimbledon news , which is great . now what we can do is point at the front of the newspaper and immediately get the bulletin . voice : ... to the grass , and it 's very important that you adapt and you , you have to be flexible , you have to be willing to change direction at a split second , and she does all that . she 's won this title . mm : and that linking of the digital content to something that 's physical is what we call an aura , and i 'll be using that term a little bit as we go through the talk . so , what 's great about this is it is n't just a faster , more convenient way to get information in the real world , but there are times when actually using this medium allows you to be able to display information in a way that was never before possible . so what i have here is a wireless router . my american colleagues have told me i 've got to call it a router , so that everyone here understands -- -- but nonetheless , here is the device . so now what i can do is , rather than getting the instructions for the device online , i can simply point at it , the device is recognized , and then -- voice : begin by plugging in the grey adsl cable . then connect the power . finally , the yellow ethernet cable . congratulations . you have now completed setup . mm : awesome . thank you . the incredible work that made that possible was done here in the u.k. by scientists at cambridge , and they work in our offices , and i 've got a lovely picture of them here . they could n't all be on stage , but we 're going to bring their aura to the stage , so here they are . they 're not very animated . this was the fourth take , i 'm told . okay . so , as we 're talking about cambridge , let 's now move on to technical advancements , because since we started putting this technology on mobile phones less than 12 months ago , the speed and the processing in these devices has grown at a really phenomenal rate , and that means that i can now take cinema - quality 3d models and place them in the world around me , so i have one over here . tamara , would you like to jump in ? mm : i should leap in . so then , after the fun , comes the more emotional side of what we do , because effectively , this technology allows you to see the world through someone 's eyes , and for that person to be able to take a moment in time and effectively store it and tag it to something physical that exists in the real world . what 's great about this is , the tools to do this are free . they 're open , they 're available to everyone within our application , and educators have really got on board with the classrooms . so we have teachers who 've tagged up textbooks , teachers who 've tagged up school classrooms , and a great example of this is a school in the u.k. i have a picture here from a video , and we 're now going to play it . teacher : see what happens . keep going . child : tv . child : oh my god . teacher : now move it either side . see what happens . move away from it and come back to it . child : oh , that is so cool . teacher : and then , have you got it again ? child : oh my god ! how did you do that ? second child : it 's magic . mm : so , it 's not magic . it 's available for everyone to do , and actually i 'm going to show you how easy it is to do by doing one right now . so , as sort of -- i 'm told it 's called a stadium wave , so we 're going to start from this side of the room on the count of three , and go over to here . tamara , are you recording ? okay , so are you all ready ? one , two , three . go ! audience : whooooooo ! mm : fellows are really good at that . okay . now we 're going to switch back into the aurasma application , and what tamara 's going to do is tag that video that we just took onto my badge , so that i can remember it forever . now , we have lots of people who are doing this already , and we 've talked a little bit about the educational side . on the emotional side , we have people who 've done things like send postcards and christmas cards back to their family with little messages on them . we have people who have , for example , taken the inside of the engine bay of an old car and tagged up different components within an engine , so that if you 're stuck and you want to find out more , you can point and discover the information . we 're all very , very familiar with the internet . in the last 20 years , it 's really changed the way that we live and work , and the way that we see the world , and what 's great is , we sort of think this is the next paradigm shift , because now we can literally take the content that we share , we discover , and that we enjoy and make it a part of the world around us . it 's completely free to download this application . if you have a good wi - fi connection or 3g , this process is very , very quick . oh , there we are . we can save it now . it 's just going to do a tiny bit of processing to convert that image that we just took into a sort of digital fingerprint , and the great thing is , if you 're a professional user , -- so , a newspaper -- the tools are pretty much identical to what we 've just used to create this demonstration . the only difference is that you 've got the ability to add in links and slightly more content . are you now ready ? tamara roukaerts : we 're ready to go . mm : okay . so , i 'm told we 're ready , which means we can now point at the image , and there you all are . mm on video : one , two , three . go ! mm : well done . we 've been aurasma . thank you .
global design	on march 14 , this year , i posted this poster on facebook . this is an image of me and my daughter holding the israeli flag . i will try to explain to you about the context of why and when i posted . a few days ago , i was sitting waiting on the line at the grocery store , and the owner and one of the clients were talking to each other , and the owner was explaining to the client that we 're going to get 10,000 missiles on israel . and the client was saying , no , it 's 10,000 a day . this is the context . this is where we are now in israel . we have this war with iran coming for 10 years now , and we have people , you know , afraid . it 's like every year it 's the last minute that we can do something about the war with iran . it 's like , if we do n't act now , it 's too late forever , for 10 years now . so at some point it became , you know , to me , i 'm a graphic designer , so i made posters about it and i posted the one i just showed you before . most of the time , i make posters , i post them on facebook , my friends like it , do n't like it , most of the time do n't like it , do n't share it , do n't nothing , and it 's another day . so i went to sleep , and that was it for me . and later on in the night , i woke up because i 'm always waking up in the night , and i went by the computer and i see all these red dots , you know , on facebook , which i 've never seen before . and i was like , " what 's going on ? " so i come to the computer and i start looking on , and suddenly i see many people talking to me , most of them i do n't know , and a few of them from iran , which is -- what ? because you have to understand , in israel we do n't talk with people from iran . we do n't know people from iran . it 's like , on facebook , you have friends only from -- it 's like your neighbors are your friends on facebook . and now people from iran are talking to me . so i start answering this girl , and she 's telling me she saw the poster and she asked her family to come , because they do n't have a computer , she asked her family to come to see the poster , and they 're all sitting in the living room crying . so i 'm like , whoa . i ask my wife to come , and i tell her , you have to see that . people are crying , and she came , she read the text , and she started to cry . and everybody 's crying now . so i do n't know what to do , so my first reflex , as a graphic designer , is , you know , to show everybody what i 'd just seen , and people started to see them and to share them , and that 's how it started . the day after , when really it became a lot of talking , i said to myself , and my wife said to me , i also want a poster , so this is her . because it 's working , put me in a poster now . but more seriously , i was like , okay , these ones work , but it 's not just about me , it 's about people from israel who want to say something . so i 'm going to shoot all the people i know , if they want , and i 'm going to put them in a poster and i 'm going to share them . so i went to my neighbors and friends and students and i just asked them , give me a picture , i will make you a poster . and that 's how it started . and that 's how , really , it 's unleashed , because suddenly people from facebook , friends and others , just understand that they can be part of it . it 's not just one dude making one poster , it 's -- we can be part of it , so they start sending me pictures and ask me , " make me a poster . post it . tell the iranians we from israel love you too . " it became , you know , at some point it was really , really intense . i mean , so many pictures , so i asked friends to come , graphic designers most of them , to make posters with me , because i did n't have the time . it was a huge amount of pictures . so for a few days , that 's how my living room was . and we received israeli posters , israeli images , but also lots of comments , lots of messages from iran . and we took these messages and we made posters out of it , because i know people : they do n't read , they see images . if it 's an image , they may read it . so here are a few of them . this one is really moving for me because it 's the story of a girl who has been raised in iran to walk on an israeli flag to enter her school every morning , and now that she sees the posters that we 're sending , she starts -- she said that she changed her mind , and now she loves that blue , she loves that star , and she loves that flag , talking about the israeli flag , and she wished that we 'd meet and come to visit one another , and just a few days after i posted the first poster . the day after , iranians started to respond with their own posters . they have graphic designers . what ? crazy , crazy . so you can see they are still shy , they do n't want to show their faces , but they want to spread the message . they want to respond . they want to say the same thing . so . and now it 's communication . it 's a two - way story . it 's israelis and iranians sending the same message , one to each other . this never happened before , and this is two people supposed to be enemies , we 're on the verge of a war , and suddenly people on facebook are starting to say , " i like this guy . i love those guys . " and it became really big at some point . and then it became news . because when you 're seeing the middle east , you see only the bad news . and suddenly , there is something that was happening that was good news . so the guys on the news , they say , " okay , let 's talk about this . " and they just came , and it was so much , i remember one day , michal , she was talking with the journalist , and she was asking him , " who 's gonna see the show ? " and he said , " everybody . " so she said , " everybody in palestine , in where ? israel ? who is everybody ? " " everybody . " they said , " syria ? " " syria . " " lebanon ? " " lebanon . " at some point , he just said , " 40 million people are going to see you today . it 's everybody . " the chinese . and we were just at the beginning of the story . something crazy also happened . every time a country started talking about it , like germany , america , wherever , a page on facebook popped up with the same logo with the same stories , so at the beginning we had " iran - loves - israel , " which is an iranian sitting in tehran , saying , " okay , israel loves iran ? i give you iran - loves - israel . " you have palestine - loves - israel . you have lebanon that just -- a few days ago . and this whole list of pages on facebook dedicated to the same message , to people sending their love , one to each other . the moment i really understood that something was happening , a friend of mine told me , " google the word ' israel . ' " and those were the first images on those days that popped up from google when you were typing , " israel " or " iran . " we really changed how people see the middle east . because you 're not in the middle east . you 're somewhere over there , and then you want to see the middle east , so you go on google and you say , " israel , " and they give you the bad stuff . and for a few days you got those images . today the israel - loves - iran page is this number , 80,831 , and two million people last week went on the page and shared , liked , i do n't know , commented on one of the photos . so for five months now , that 's what we are doing , me , michal , a few of my friends , are just making images . we 're showing a new reality by just making images because that 's how the world perceives us . they see images of us , and they see bad images . so we 're working on making good images . end of story . look at this one . this is the iran - loves - israel page . this is not the israel - loves - iran . this is not my page . this is a guy in tehran on the day of remembrance of the israeli fallen soldier putting an image of an israeli soldier on his page . this is the enemy . what ? and it 's going both ways . it 's like , we are showing respect , one to each other . and we 're understanding . and you show compassion . and you become friends . and at some point , you become friends on facebook , and you become friends in life . you can go and travel and meet people . and i was in munich a few weeks ago . i went there to open an exposition about iran and i met there with people from the page that told me , " okay , you 're going to be in europe , i 'm coming . i 'm coming from france , from holland , from germany , " of course , and from israel people came , and we just met there for the first time in real life . i met with people that are supposed to be my enemies for the first time . and we just shake hands , and have a coffee and a nice discussion , and we talk about food and basketball . and that was the end of it . remember that image from the beginning ? at some point we met in real life , and we became friends . and it goes the other way around . some girl that we met on facebook never been in israel , born and raised in iran , lives in germany , afraid of israelis because of what she knows about us , decides after a few months of talking on the internet with some israelis to come to israel , and she gets on the plane and arrives at ben gurion and says , " okay , not that big a deal . " so a few weeks ago , the stress is getting higher , so we start this new campaign called " not ready to die in your war . " i mean , it 's plus / minus the same message , but we wanted really to add some aggressivity to it . and again , something amazing happened , something that we did n't have on the first wave of the campaign . now people from iran , the same ones who were shy at the first campaign and just sent , you know , their foot and half their faces , now they 're sending their faces , and they 're saying , " okay , no problem , we 're into it . we are with you . " just read where those guys are from . and for every guy from israel , you 've got someone from iran . just people sending their pictures . crazy , yes ? so -- so you may ask yourself , who is this dude ? my name is ronny edry , and i 'm 41 , i 'm an israeli , i 'm a father of two , i 'm a husband , and i 'm a graphic designer . i 'm teaching graphic design . and i 'm not that naive , because a lot of the time i 've been asked , many times i 've been asked , " yeah , but , this is really naive , sending flowers over , i mean -- " i was in the army . i was in the paratroopers for three years , and i know how it looks from the ground . i know how it can look really bad . so to me , this is the courageous thing to do , to try to reach the other side before it 's too late , because when it 's going to be too late , it 's going to be too late . and sometimes war is inevitable , sometimes , but maybe [ with ] effort , we can avoid it . maybe as people , because especially in israel , we 're in a democracy . we have the freedom of speech , and maybe that little thing can change something . and really , we can be our own ambassadors . we can just send a message and hope for the best . so i want to ask michal , my wife , to come with me on the stage just to make with you one image , because it 's all about images . and maybe that image will help us change something . just raise that . exactly . and i 'm just going to take a picture of it , and i 'm just going to post it on facebook with kind of " israelis for peace " or something . oh my god . do n't cry . thank you guys .
entertainment	chris anderson : you guys were amazing . that 's amazing . you just do n't hear that every day . usman , the official story is that you learned to play the guitar by watching jimmy page on youtube . usman riaz : yes , that was the first one . and then i -- that was the first thing i learned , and then i started progressing to other things . and i started watching kaki king a lot , and she would always cite preston reed as a big influence , so then i started watching his videos , and it 's very surreal right now to be -- ca : was that piece just now , that was one of his songs that you learned , or how did that happen ? ur : i 'd never learned it before , but he told me that we would be playing that on stage , so i was familiar with it , so that 's why i had so much more fun learning it . and it finally happened , so ... ca : preston , from your point of view , i mean , you invented this like 20 years ago , right ? how does it feel to see someone like this come along taking your art and doing so much with it ? preston reed : it 's mind - blowing , and i feel really proud , really honored . and he 's a wonderful musician , so it 's cool . ca : i guess , i do n't think there is like a one - minute other piece you guys can do ? can you ? do you jam ? do you have anything else ? pr : we have n't prepared anything . ca : there is n't . i 'll tell you what . if you have another 30 or 40 seconds , and you have another 30 or 40 seconds , and we just see that , i just think -- i can feel it . we want to hear a little more . and if it goes horribly wrong , no worries .
health business	what you 're doing , right now , at this very moment , is killing you . more than cars or the internet or even that little mobile device we keep talking about , the technology you 're using the most almost every day is this , your tush . nowadays people are sitting 9.3 hours a day , which is more than we 're sleeping , at 7.7 hours . sitting is so incredibly prevalent , we do n't even question how much we 're doing it , and because everyone else is doing it , it does n't even occur to us that it 's not okay . in that way , sitting has become the smoking of our generation . of course there 's health consequences to this , scary ones , besides the waist . things like breast cancer and colon cancer are directly tied to our lack of physical [ activity ] , ten percent in fact , on both of those . six percent for heart disease , seven percent for type 2 diabetes , which is what my father died of . now , any of those stats should convince each of us to get off our duff more , but if you 're anything like me , it wo n't . what did get me moving was a social interaction . someone invited me to a meeting , but could n't manage to fit me in to a regular sort of conference room meeting , and said , " i have to walk my dogs tomorrow . could you come then ? " it seemed kind of odd to do , and actually , that first meeting , i remember thinking , " i have to be the one to ask the next question , " because i knew i was going to huff and puff during this conversation . and yet , i 've taken that idea and made it my own . so instead of going to coffee meetings or fluorescent - lit conference room meetings , i ask people to go on a walking meeting , to the tune of 20 to 30 miles a week . it 's changed my life . but before that , what actually happened was , i used to think about it as , you could take care of your health , or you could take care of obligations , and one always came at the cost of the other . so now , several hundred of these walking meetings later , i 've learned a few things . first , there 's this amazing thing about actually getting out of the box that leads to out - of - the - box thinking . whether it 's nature or the exercise itself , it certainly works . and second , and probably the more reflective one , is just about how much each of us can hold problems in opposition when they 're really not that way . and if we 're going to solve problems and look at the world really differently , whether it 's in governance or business or environmental issues , job creation , maybe we can think about how to reframe those problems as having both things be true . because it was when that happened with this walk - and - talk idea that things became doable and sustainable and viable . so i started this talk talking about the tush , so i 'll end with the bottom line , which is , walk and talk . walk the talk . you 'll be surprised at how fresh air drives fresh thinking , and in the way that you do , you 'll bring into your life an entirely new set of ideas . thank you .
health	life is about opportunities , creating them and embracing them , and for me , that was the olympic dream . that 's what defined me . that was my bliss . as a cross - country skier and member of the australian ski team , headed towards the winter olympics , i was on a training bike ride with my fellow teammates . as we made our way up towards the spectacular blue mountains west of sydney , it was the perfect autumn day : sunshine , the smell of eucalypt and a dream . life was good . we 'd been on our bikes for around five and half hours when we got to the part of the ride that i loved , and that was the hills , because i loved the hills . and i got up off the seat of my bike , and i started pumping my legs , and as i sucked in the cold mountain air , i could feel it burning my lungs , and i looked up to see the sun shining in my face . and then everything went black . where was i ? what was happening ? my body was consumed by pain . i 'd been hit by a speeding utility truck with only 10 minutes to go on the bike ride . i was airlifted from the scene of the accident by a rescue helicopter to a large spinal unit in sydney . i had extensive and life - threatening injuries . i 'd broken my neck and my back in six places . i broke five ribs on my left side . i broke my right arm . i broke my collarbone . i broke some bones in my feet . my whole right side was ripped open , filled with gravel . my head was cut open across the front , lifted back , exposing the skull underneath . i had head injures . i had internal injuries . i had massive blood loss . in fact , i lost about five liters of blood , which is all someone my size would actually hold . by the time the helicopter arrived at prince henry hospital in sydney , my blood pressure was 40 over nothing . i was having a really bad day . for over 10 days , i drifted between two dimensions . i had an awareness of being in my body , but also being out of my body , somewhere else , watching from above as if it was happening to someone else . why would i want to go back to a body that was so broken ? but this voice kept calling me : " come on , stay with me . " " no. it 's too hard . " " come on . this is our opportunity . " " no. that body is broken . it can no longer serve me . " " come on . stay with me . we can do it . we can do it together . " i was at a crossroads . i knew if i did n't return to my body , i 'd have to leave this world forever . it was the fight of my life . after 10 days , i made the decision to return to my body , and the internal bleeding stopped . the next concern was whether i would walk again , because i was paralyzed from the waist down . they said to my parents , the neck break was a stable fracture , but the back was completely crushed . the vertebra at l 1 was like you 'd dropped a peanut , stepped on it , smashed it into thousands of pieces . they 'd have to operate . they went in . they put me on a beanbag . they cut me , literally cut me in half , i have a scar that wraps around my entire body . they picked as much broken bone as they could that had lodged in my spinal cord . they took out two of my broken ribs , and they rebuilt my back , l 1 , they rebuilt it , they took out another broken rib , they fused t 12 , l 1 and l 2 together . then they stitched me up . they took an entire hour to stitch me up . i woke up in intensive care , and the doctors were really excited that the operation had been a success because at that stage i had a little bit of movement in one of my big toes , and i thought , " great , because i 'm going to the olympics ! " i had no idea . that 's the sort of thing that happens to someone else , not me , surely . but then the doctor came over to me , and she said , " janine , the operation was a success , and we 've picked as much bone out of your spinal cord as we could , but the damage is permanent . the central nervous system nerves , there is no cure . you 're what we call a partial paraplegic , and you 'll have all of the injuries that go along with that . you have no feeling from the waist down , and at most , you might get 10- or 20 - percent return . you 'll have internal injuries for the rest of your life . you 'll have to use a catheter for the rest of your life . and if you walk again , it will be with calipers and a walking frame . " and then she said , " janine , you 'll have to rethink everything you do in your life , because you 're never going to be able to do the things you did before . " i tried to grasp what she was saying . i was an athlete . that 's all i knew . that 's all i 'd done . if i could n't do that , then what could i do ? and the question i asked myself is , if i could n't do that , then who was i ? they moved me from intensive care to acute spinal . i was lying on a thin , hard spinal bed . i had no movement in my legs . i had tight stockings on to protect from blood clots . i had one arm in plaster , one arm tied down by drips . i had a neck brace and sandbags on either side of my head and i saw my world through a mirror that was suspended above my head . i shared the ward with five other people , and the amazing thing is that because we were all lying paralyzed in a spinal ward , we did n't know what each other looked like . how amazing is that ? how often in life do you get to make friendships , judgment - free , purely based on spirit ? and there were no superficial conversations as we shared our innermost thoughts , our fears , and our hopes for life after the spinal ward . i remember one night , one of the nurses came in , jonathan , with a whole lot of plastic straws . he put a pile on top of each of us , and he said , " start threading them together . " well , there was n't much else to do in the spinal ward , so we did . and when we 'd finished , he went around silently and he joined all of the straws up till it looped around the whole ward , and then he said , " okay , everybody , hold on to your straws . " and we did . and he said , " right . now we 're all connected . " and as we held on , and we breathed as one , we knew we were n't on this journey alone . and even lying paralyzed in the spinal ward , there were moments of incredible depth and richness , of authenticity and connection that i had never experienced before . and each of us knew that when we left the spinal ward we would never be the same . after six months , it was time to go home . i remember dad pushing me outside in my wheelchair , wrapped in a plaster body cast , and feeling the sun on my face for the first time . i soaked it up and i thought , how could i ever have taken this for granted ? i felt so incredibly grateful for my life . but before i left the hospital , the head nurse had said to me , " janine , i want you to be ready , because when you get home , something 's going to happen . " and i said , " what ? " and she said , " you 're going to get depressed . " and i said , " not me , not janine the machine , " which was my nickname . she said , " you are , because , see , it happens to everyone . in the spinal ward , that 's normal . you 're in a wheelchair . that 's normal . but you 're going to get home and realize how different life is . " and i got home and something happened . i realized sister sam was right . i did get depressed . i was in my wheelchair . i had no feeling from the waist down , attached to a catheter bottle . i could n't walk . i 'd lost so much weight in the hospital i now weighed about 80 pounds . and i wanted to give up . all i wanted to do was put my running shoes on and run out the door . i wanted my old life back . i wanted my body back . and i can remember mom sitting on the end of my bed , and saying , " i wonder if life will ever be good again . " and i thought , " how could it ? because i 've lost everything that i valued , everything that i 'd worked towards . gone . " and the question i asked was , " why me ? why me ? " and then i remembered my friends that were still in the spinal ward , particularly maria . maria was in a car accident , and she woke up on her 16th birthday to the news that she was a complete quadriplegic , had no movement from the neck down , had damage to her vocal chords , and she could n't talk . they told me , " we 're going to move you next to her because we think it will be good for her . " i was worried . i did n't know how i 'd react to being next to her . i knew it would be challenging , but it was actually a blessing , because maria always smiled . she was always happy , and even when she began to talk again , albeit difficult to understand , she never complained , not once . and i wondered how had she ever found that level of acceptance . and i realized that this was n't just my life . it was life itself . i realized that this was n't just my pain . it was everybody 's pain . and then i knew , just like before , that i had a choice . i could keep fighting this or i could let go and accept not only my body but the circumstances of my life . and then i stopped asking , " why me ? " and i started to ask , " why not me ? " and then i thought to myself , maybe being at rock bottom is actually the perfect place to start . i had never before thought of myself as a creative person . i was an athlete . my body was a machine . but now i was about to embark on the most creative project that any of us could ever do : that of rebuilding a life . and even though i had absolutely no idea what i was going to do , in that uncertainty came a sense of freedom . i was no longer tied to a set path . i was free to explore life 's infinite possibilities . and that realization was about to change my life . sitting at home in my wheelchair and my plaster body cast , an airplane flew overhead , and i looked up , and i thought to myself , " that 's it ! if i ca n't walk , then i might as well fly . " i said , " mom , i 'm going to learn how to fly . " she said , " that 's nice , dear . " i said , " pass me the yellow pages . " she passed me the phone book , i rang up the flying school , i made a booking , said i 'd like to make a booking to come out for a flight . they said , " you know , when do you want to come out ? " i said , " well , i have to get a friend to drive me out because i ca n't drive . sort of ca n't walk either . is that a problem ? " i made a booking , and weeks later my friend chris and my mom drove me out to the airport , all 80 pounds of me covered in a plaster body cast in a baggy pair of overalls . i can tell you , i did not look like the ideal candidate to get a pilot 's license . i 'm holding on to the counter because i ca n't stand . i said , " hi , i 'm here for a flying lesson . " and they took one look and ran out the back to draw short straws . " you get her . " " no , no , you take her . " finally this guy comes out . he goes , " hi , i 'm andrew , and i 'm going to take you flying . " i go , " great . " and so they drive me down , they get me out on the tarmac , and there was this red , white and blue airplane . it was beautiful . they lifted me into the cockpit . they had to slide me up on the wing , put me in the cockpit . they sat me down . there are buttons and dials everywhere . i 'm going , " wow , how do you ever know what all these buttons and dials do ? " andrew the instructor got in the front , started the airplane up . he said , " would you like to have a go at taxiing ? " that 's when you use your feet to control the rudder pedals to control the airplane on the ground . i said , " no , i ca n't use my legs . " he went , " oh . " i said , " but i can use my hands , " and he said , " okay . " so he got over to the runway , and he applied the power . and as we took off down the runway , and the wheels lifted up off the tarmac , and we became airborne , i had the most incredible sense of freedom . and andrew said to me , as we got over the training area , " you see that mountain over there ? " and i said , " yeah . " and he said , " well , you take the controls , and you fly towards that mountain . " and as i looked up , i realized that he was pointing towards the blue mountains where the journey had begun . and i took the controls , and i was flying . and i was a long , long way from that spinal ward , and i knew right then that i was going to be a pilot . did n't know how on earth i 'd ever pass a medical . but i 'd worry about that later , because right now i had a dream . so i went home , i got a training diary out , and i had a plan . and i practiced my walking as much as i could , and i went from the point of two people holding me up to one person holding me up to the point where i could walk around the furniture as long as it was n't too far apart . and then i made great progression to the point where i could walk around the house , holding onto the walls , like this , and mom said she was forever following me , wiping off my fingerprints . but at least she always knew where i was . so while the doctors continued to operate and put my body back together again , i went on with my theory study , and then eventually , and amazingly , i passed my pilot 's medical , and that was my green light to fly . and i spent every moment i could out at that flying school , way out of my comfort zone , all these young guys that wanted to be qantas pilots , you know , and little old hop - along me in first my plaster cast , and then my steel brace , my baggy overalls , my bag of medication and catheters and my limp , and they used to look at me and think , " oh , who is she kidding ? she 's never going to be able to do this . " and sometimes i thought that too . but that did n't matter , because now there was something inside that burned that far outweighed my injuries . and little goals kept me going along the way , and eventually i got my private pilot 's license , and then i learned to navigate , and i flew my friends around australia . and then i learned to fly an airplane with two engines and i got my twin engine rating . and then i learned to fly in bad weather as well as fine weather and got my instrument rating . and then i got my commercial pilot 's license . and then i got my instructor rating . and then i found myself back at that same school where i 'd gone for that very first flight , teaching other people how to fly , just under 18 months after i 'd left the spinal ward . and then i thought , " why stop there ? why not learn to fly upside down ? " and i did , and i learned to fly upside down and became an aerobatics flying instructor . and mom and dad ? never been up . but then i knew for certain that although my body might be limited , it was my spirit that was unstoppable . the philosopher lao tzu once said , " when you let go of what you are , you become what you might be . " i now know that it was n't until i let go of who i thought i was that i was able to create a completely new life . it was n't until i let go of the life i thought i should have that i was able to embrace the life that was waiting for me . i now know that my real strength never came from my body , and although my physical capabilities have changed dramatically , who i am is unchanged . the pilot light inside of me was still a light , just as it is in each and every one of us . i know that i 'm not my body , and i also know that you 're not yours . and then it no longer matters what you look like , where you come from , or what you do for a living . all that matters is that we continue to fan the flame of humanity by living our lives as the ultimate creative expression of who we really are , because we are all connected by millions and millions of straws , and it 's time to join those up and to hang on . and if we are to move towards our collective bliss , it 's time we shed our focus on the physical and instead embrace the virtues of the heart . so raise your straws if you 'll join me . thank you . thank you .
education	there 's a group of people in kenya . people cross oceans to go see them . these people are tall . they jump high . they wear red . and they kill lions . you might be wondering , who are these people ? these are the maasais . and you know what 's cool ? i 'm actually one of them . the maasais , the boys are brought up to be warriors . the girls are brought up to be mothers . when i was five years old , i found out that i was engaged to be married as soon as i reached puberty . my mother , my grandmother , my aunties , they constantly reminded me that your husband just passed by . cool , yeah ? and everything i had to do from that moment was to prepare me to be a perfect woman at age 12 . my day started at 5 in the morning , milking the cows , sweeping the house , cooking for my siblings , collecting water , firewood . i did everything that i needed to do to become a perfect wife . i went to school not because the maasais ' women or girls were going to school . it 's because my mother was denied an education , and she constantly reminded me and my siblings that she never wanted us to live the life she was living . why did she say that ? my father worked as a policeman in the city . he came home once a year . we did n't see him for sometimes even two years . and whenever he came home , it was a different case . my mother worked hard in the farm to grow crops so that we can eat . she reared the cows and the goats so that she can care for us . but when my father came , he would sell the cows , he would sell the products we had , and he went and drank with his friends in the bars . because my mother was a woman , she was not allowed to own any property , and by default , everything in my family anyway belongs to my father , so he had the right . and if my mother ever questioned him , he beat her , abused her , and really it was difficult . when i went to school , i had a dream . i wanted to become a teacher . teachers looked nice . they wear nice dresses , high - heeled shoes . i found out later that they are uncomfortable , but i admired it . but most of all , the teacher was just writing on the board -- not hard work , that 's what i thought , compared to what i was doing in the farm . so i wanted to become a teacher . i worked hard in school , but when i was in eighth grade , it was a determining factor . in our tradition , there is a ceremony that girls have to undergo to become women , and it 's a rite of passage to womanhood . and then i was just finishing my eighth grade , and that was a transition for me to go to high school . this was the crossroad . once i go through this tradition , i was going to become a wife . well , my dream of becoming a teacher will not come to pass . so i talked -- i had to come up with a plan to figure these things out . i talked to my father . i did something that most girls have never done . i told my father , " i will only go through this ceremony if you let me go back to school . " the reason why , if i ran away , my father will have a stigma , people will be calling him the father of that girl who did n't go through the ceremony . it was a shameful thing for him to carry the rest of his life . so he figured out . " well , " he said , " okay , you 'll go to school after the ceremony . " i did . the ceremony happened . it 's a whole week long of excitement . it 's a ceremony . people are enjoying it . and the day before the actual ceremony happens , we were dancing , having excitement , and through all the night we did not sleep . the actual day came , and we walked out of the house that we were dancing in . yes , we danced and danced . we walked out to the courtyard , and there were a bunch of people waiting . they were all in a circle . and as we danced and danced , and we approached this circle of women , men , women , children , everybody was there . there was a woman sitting in the middle of it , and this woman was waiting to hold us . i was the first . there were my sisters and a couple of other girls , and as i approached her , she looked at me , and i sat down . and i sat down , and i opened my legs . as i opened my leg , another woman came , and this woman was carrying a knife . and as she carried the knife , she walked toward me and she held the clitoris , and she cut it off . as you can imagine , i bled . i bled . after bleeding for a while , i fainted thereafter . it 's something that so many girls -- i 'm lucky , i never died -- but many die . it 's practiced , it 's no anesthesia , it 's a rusty old knife , and it was difficult . i was lucky because one , also , my mom did something that most women do n't do . three days later , after everybody has left the home , my mom went and brought a nurse . we were taken care of . three weeks later , i was healed , and i was back in high school . i was so determined to be a teacher now so that i could make a difference in my family . well , while i was in high school , something happened . i met a young gentleman from our village who had been to the university of oregon . this man was wearing a white t - shirt , jeans , camera , white sneakers -- and i 'm talking about white sneakers . there is something about clothes , i think , and shoes . they were sneakers , and this is in a village that does n't even have paved roads . it was quite attractive . i told him , " well , i want to go to where you are , " because this man looked very happy , and i admired that . and he told me , " well , what do you mean , you want to go ? do n't you have a husband waiting for you ? " and i told him , " do n't worry about that part . just tell me how to get there . " this gentleman , he helped me . while i was in high school also , my dad was sick . he got a stroke , and he was really , really sick , so he really could n't tell me what to do next . but the problem is , my father is not the only father i have . everybody who is my dad 's age , male in the community , is my father by default -- my uncles , all of them -- and they dictate what my future is . so the news came , i applied to school and i was accepted to randolph - macon woman 's college in lynchburg , virginia , and i could n't come without the support of the village , because i needed to raise money to buy the air ticket . i got a scholarship but i needed to get myself here . but i needed the support of the village , and here again , when the men heard , and the people heard that a woman had gotten an opportunity to go to school , they said , " what a lost opportunity . this should have been given to a boy . we ca n't do this . " so i went back and i had to go back to the tradition . there 's a belief among our people that morning brings good news . so i had to come up with something to do with the morning , because there 's good news in the morning . and in the village also , there is one chief , an elder , who if he says yes , everybody will follow him . so i went to him very early in the morning , as the sun rose . the first thing he sees when he opens his door is , it 's me . " my child , what are you doing here ? " " well , dad , i need help . can you support me to go to america ? " i promised him that i would be the best girl , i will come back , anything they wanted after that , i will do it for them . he said , " well , but i ca n't do it alone . " he gave me a list of another 15 men that i went -- 16 more men -- every single morning i went and visited them . they all came together . the village , the women , the men , everybody came together to support me to come to get an education . i arrived in america . as you can imagine , what did i find ? i found snow ! i found wal - marts , vacuum cleaners , and lots of food in the cafeteria . i was in a land of plenty . i enjoyed myself , but during that moment while i was here , i discovered a lot of things . i learned that that ceremony that i went through when i was 13 years old , it was called female genital mutilation . i learned that it was against the law in kenya . i learned that i did not have to trade part of my body to get an education . i had a right . and as we speak right now , three million girls in africa are at risk of going through this mutilation . i learned that my mom had a right to own property . i learned that she did not have to be abused because she is a woman . those things made me angry . i wanted to do something . as i went back , every time i went , i found that my neighbors ' girls were getting married . they were getting mutilated , and here , after i graduated from here , i worked at the u.n. , i went back to school to get my graduate work , the constant cry of these girls was in my face . i had to do something . as i went back , i started talking to the men , to the village , and mothers , and i said , " i want to give back the way i had promised you that i would come back and help you . what do you need ? " as i spoke to the women , they told me , " you know what we need ? we really need a school for girls . " because there had not been any school for girls . and the reason they wanted the school for girls is because when a girl is raped when she 's walking to school , the mother is blamed for that . if she got pregnant before she got married , the mother is blamed for that , and she 's punished . she 's beaten . they said , " we wanted to put our girls in a safe place . " as we moved , and i went to talk to the fathers , the fathers , of course , you can imagine what they said : " we want a school for boys . " and i said , " well , there are a couple of men from my village who have been out and they have gotten an education . why ca n't they build a school for boys , and i 'll build a school for girls ? " that made sense . and they agreed . and i told them , i wanted them to show me a sign of commitment . and they did . they donated land where we built the girls ' school . we have . i want you to meet one of the girls in that school . angeline came to apply for the school , and she did not meet any criteria that we had . she 's an orphan . yes , we could have taken her for that . but she was older . she was 12 years old , and we were taking girls who were in fourth grade . angeline had been moving from one place -- because she 's an orphan , she has no mother , she has no father -- moving from one grandmother 's house to another one , from aunties to aunties . she had no stability in her life . and i looked at her , i remember that day , and i saw something beyond what i was seeing in angeline . and yes , she was older to be in fourth grade . we gave her the opportunity to come to the class . five months later , that is angeline . a transformation had begun in her life . angeline wants to be a pilot so she can fly around the world and make a difference . she was not the top student when we took her . now she 's the best student , not just in our school , but in the entire division that we are in . that 's sharon . that 's five years later . that 's evelyn . five months later , that is the difference that we are making . as a new dawn is happening in my school , a new beginning is happening . as we speak right now , 125 girls will never be mutilated . one hundred twenty - five girls will not be married when they 're 12 years old . one hundred twenty - five girls are creating and achieving their dreams . this is the thing that we are doing , giving them opportunities where they can rise . as we speak right now , women are not being beaten because of the revolutions we 've started in our community . i want to challenge you today . you are listening to me because you are here , very optimistic . you are somebody who is so passionate . you are somebody who wants to see a better world . you are somebody who wants to see that war ends , no poverty . you are somebody who wants to make a difference . you are somebody who wants to make our tomorrow better . i want to challenge you today that to be the first , because people will follow you . be the first . people will follow you . be bold . stand up . be fearless . be confident . move out , because as you change your world , as you change your community , as we believe that we are impacting one girl , one family , one village , one country at a time . we are making a difference , so if you change your world , you are going to change your community , you are going to change your country , and think about that . if you do that , and i do that , are n't we going to create a better future for our children , for your children , for our grandchildren ? and we will live in a very peaceful world . thank you very much .
culture art	two years ago , i was invited as an artist to participate in an exhibition commemorating 100 years of islamic art in europe . the curator had only one condition : i had to use the arabic script for my artwork . now , as an artist , a woman , an arab , or a human being living in the world in 2010 , i only had one thing to say : i wanted to say no. and in arabic , to say " no , " we say " no , and a thousand times no. " so i decided to look for a thousand different noes . on everything ever produced under islamic or arab patronage in the past 1,400 years , from spain to the borders of china . i collected my findings in a book , placed them chronologically , stating the name , the patron , the medium and the date . now , the book sat on a small shelf next to the installation , which stood three by seven meters , in munich , germany , in september of 2010 . now , in january , 2011 , the revolution started , and life stopped for 18 days , and on the 12th of february , we naively celebrated on the streets of cairo , believing that the revolution had succeeded . nine months later i found myself spraying messages in tahrir square . the reason for this act was this image that i saw in my newsfeed . i did not feel that i could live in a city where people were being killed and thrown like garbage on the street . so i took one " no " off a tombstone from the islamic museum in cairo , and i added a message to it : " no to military rule . " and i started spraying that on the streets in cairo . but that led to a series of no , coming out of the book like ammunition , and adding messages to them , and i started spraying them on the walls . so i 'll be sharing some of these noes with you . no to a new pharaoh , because whoever comes next should understand that we will never be ruled by another dictator . no to violence : ramy essam came to tahrir on the second day of the revolution , and he sat there with this guitar , singing . one month after mubarak stepped down , this was his reward . no to blinding heroes . ahmed harara lost his right eye on the 28th of january , and he lost his left eye on the 19th of november , by two different snipers . no to killing , in this case no to killing men of religion , because sheikh ahmed adina refaat was shot on december 16th , during a demonstration , leaving behind three orphans and a widow . no to burning books . the institute of egypt was burned on december 17th , a huge cultural loss . no to stripping the people , and the blue bra is to remind us of our shame as a nation when we allow a veiled woman to be stripped and beaten on the street , and the footprint reads , " long live a peaceful revolution , " because we will never retaliate with violence . no to barrier walls . on february 5th , concrete roadblocks were set up in cairo to protect the ministry of defense from protesters . now , speaking of walls , i want to share with you the story of one wall in cairo . a group of artists decided to paint a life - size tank on a wall . it 's one to one . in front of this tank there 's a man on a bicycle with a breadbasket on his head . to any passerby , there 's no problem with this visual . after acts of violence , another artist came , painted blood , protesters being run over by the tank , demonstrators , and a message that read , " starting tomorrow , i wear the new face , the face of every martyr . i exist . " authority comes , paints the wall white , leaves the tank and adds a message : " army and people , one hand . egypt for egyptians . " another artist comes , paints the head of the military as a monster eating a maiden in a river of blood in front of the tank . authority comes , paints the wall white , leaves the tank , leaves the suit , and throws a bucket of black paint just to hide the face of the monster . so i come with my stencils , and i spray them on the suit , on the tank , and on the whole wall , and this is how it stands today until further notice . now , i want to leave you with a final no. i found neruda scribbled on a piece of paper in a field hospital in tahrir , and i decided to take a no of mamluk mausoleum in cairo . the message reads , [ arabic ] " you can crush the flowers , but you ca n't delay spring . " thank you . thank you . shukran .
art entertainment	i 'm going to tell you about an affliction i suffer from . and i have a funny feeling that quite a few of you suffer from it as well . when i 'm walking around an art gallery , rooms and rooms full of paintings , after about 15 or 20 minutes , i realize i 'm not thinking about the paintings . i 'm not connecting to them . instead , i 'm thinking about that cup of coffee i desperately need to wake me up . i 'm suffering from gallery fatigue . how many of you out there suffer from -- yes . ha ha , ha ha ! now , sometimes you might last longer than 20 minutes , or even shorter , but i think we all suffer from it . and do you have the accompanying guilt ? for me , i look at the paintings on the wall and i think , somebody has decided to put them there , thinks they 're good enough to be on that wall , but i do n't always see it . in fact , most of the time i do n't see it . and i leave feeling actually unhappy . i feel guilty and unhappy with myself , rather than thinking there 's something wrong with the painting , i think there 's something wrong with me . and that 's not a good experience , to leave a gallery like that . the thing is , i think we should give ourselves a break . if you think about going into a restaurant , when you look at the menu , are you expected to order every single thing on the menu ? no ! you select . if you go into a department store to buy a shirt , are you going to try on every single shirt and want every single shirt ? of course not , you can be selective . it 's expected . how come , then , it 's not so expected to be selective when we go to an art gallery ? why are we supposed to have a connection with every single painting ? well i 'm trying to take a different approach . and there 's two things i do : when i go into a gallery , first of all , i go quite fast , and i look at everything , and i pinpoint the ones that make me slow down for some reason or other . i do n't even know why they make me slow down , but something pulls me like a magnet and then i ignore all the others , and i just go to that painting . so it 's the first thing i do is , i do my own curation . i choose a painting . it might just be one painting in 50 . and then the second thing i do is i stand in front of that painting , and i tell myself a story about it . why a story ? well , i think that we are wired , our dna tells us to tell stories . we tell stories all the time about everything , and i think we do it because the world is kind of a crazy , chaotic place , and sometimes stories , we 're trying to make sense of the world a little bit , trying to bring some order to it . why not apply that to our looking at paintings ? so i now have this sort of restaurant menu visiting of art galleries . there are three paintings i 'm going to show you now that are paintings that made me stop in my tracks and want to tell stories about them . the first one needs little introduction -- " girl with a pearl earring " by johannes vermeer , 17th - century dutch painter . this is the most glorious painting . i first saw it when i was 19 , and i immediately went out and got a poster of it , and in fact i still have that poster . 30 years later it 's hanging in my house . it 's accompanied me everywhere i 've gone , i never tire of looking at her . what made me stop in my tracks about her to begin with was just the gorgeous colors he uses and the light falling on her face . but i think what 's kept me still coming back year after year is another thing , and that is the look on her face , the conflicted look on her face . i ca n't tell if she 's happy or sad , and i change my mind all the time . so that keeps me coming back . one day , 16 years after i had this poster on my wall , i lay in bed and looked at her , and i suddenly thought , i wonder what the painter did to her to make her look like that . and it was the first time i 'd ever thought that the expression on her face is actually reflecting how she feels about him . always before i 'd thought of it as a portrait of a girl . now i began to think of it as a portrait of a relationship . and i thought , well , what is that relationship ? so i went to find out . i did some research and discovered , we have no idea who she is . in fact , we do n't know who any of the models in any of vermeer 's paintings are , and we know very little about vermeer himself . which made me go , " yippee ! " i can do whatever i want , i can come up with whatever story i want to . so here 's how i came up with the story . first of all , i thought , i 've got to get her into the house . how does vermeer know her ? well , there 've been suggestions that she is his 12 - year - old daughter . the daughter at the time was 12 when he painted the painting . and i thought , no , it 's a very intimate look , but it 's not a look a daughter gives her father . for one thing , in dutch painting of the time , if a woman 's mouth was open , it was indicating sexual availability . it would have been inappropriate for vermeer to paint his daughter like that . so it 's not his daughter , but it 's somebody close to him , physically close to him . well , who else would be in the house ? a servant , a lovely servant . so , she 's in the house . how do we get her into the studio ? we do n't know very much about vermeer , but the little bits that we do know , one thing we know is that he married a catholic woman , they lived with her mother in a house where he had his own room where he -- his studio . he also had 11 children . it would have been a chaotic , noisy household . and if you 've seen vermeer 's paintings before , you know that they 're incredibly calm and quiet . how does a painter paint such calm , quiet paintings with 11 kids around ? well , he compartmentalizes his life . he gets to his studio , and he says , " nobody comes in here . not the wife , not the kids . okay , the maid can come in and clean . " she 's in the studio . he 's got her in the studio , they 're together . and he decides to paint her . he has her wear very plain clothes . now , all of the women , or most of the women in vermeer 's other paintings wore velvet , silk , fur , very sumptuous materials . this is very plain ; the only thing that is n't plain is her pearl earring . now , if she 's a servant , there is no way she could afford a pair of pearl earrings . so those are not her pearl earrings . whose are they ? we happen to know , there 's a list of catharina , the wife 's clothes . amongst them a yellow coat with white fur , a yellow and black bodice , and you see these clothes on lots of other paintings , different women in the paintings , vermeer 's paintings . so clearly , her clothes were lent to various different women . it 's not such a leap of faith to take that that pearl earring actually belongs to his wife . so we 've got all the elements for our story . she 's in the studio with him for a long time . these paintings took a long time to make . they would have spent the time alone , all that time . she 's wearing his wife 's pearl earring . she 's gorgeous . she obviously loves him . she 's conflicted . and does the wife know ? maybe not . and if she does n't , well -- that 's the story . the next painting i 'm going to talk about is called " boy building a house of cards " by chardin . he 's an 18th - century french painter best known for his still lifes , but he did occasionally paint people . and in fact , he painted four versions of this painting , different boys building houses of cards , all concentrated . i like this version the best , because some of the boys are older and some are younger , and to me , this one , like goldilocks 's porridge , is just right . he 's not quite a child , and he 's not quite a man . he 's absolutely balanced between innocence and experience , and that made me stop in my tracks in front of this painting . and i looked at his face . it 's like a vermeer painting a bit . the light comes in from the left , his face is bathed in this glowing light . it 's right in the center of the painting , and you look at it , and i found that when i was looking at it , i was standing there going , " look at me . please look at me . " and he did n't look at me . he was still looking at his cards , and that 's one of the seductive elements of this painting is , he 's so focused on what he 's doing that he does n't look at us . and that is , to me , the sign of a masterpiece , of a painting when there 's a lack of resolution . he 's never going to look at me . so i was thinking of a story where , if i 'm in this position , who could be there looking at him ? not the painter , i do n't want to think about the painter . i 'm thinking of an older version of himself . he 's a man , a servant , an older servant looking at this younger servant , saying , " look at me . i want to warn you about what you 're about to go through . please look at me . " and he never does . and that lack of resolution , the lack of resolution in " girl with a pearl earring " -- we do n't know if she 's happy or sad . i 've written an entire novel about her , and i still do n't know if she 's happy or sad . again and again , back to the painting , looking for the answer , looking for the story to fill in that gap . and we may make a story , and it satisfies us momentarily , but not really , and we come back again and again . the last painting i 'm going to talk about is called " anonymous " by anonymous . this is a tudor portrait bought by the national portrait gallery . they thought it was a man named sir thomas overbury , and then they discovered that it was n't him , and they have no idea who it is . now , in the national portrait gallery , if you do n't know the biography of the painting , it 's kind of useless to you . they ca n't hang it on the wall , because they do n't know who he is . so unfortunately , this orphan spends most of his time in storage , along with quite a number of other orphans , some of them some beautiful paintings . this painting made me stop in my tracks for three reasons : one is the disconnection between his mouth that 's smiling and his eyes that are wistful . he 's not happy , and why is n't he happy ? the second thing that really attracted me were his bright red cheeks . he is blushing . he 's blushing for his portrait being made ! this must be a guy who blushes all the time . what is he thinking about that 's making him blush ? the third thing that made me stop in my tracks is his absolutely gorgeous doublet . silk , gray , those beautiful buttons . and you know what it makes me think of , is it 's sort of snug and puffy ; it 's like a duvet spread over a bed . i kept thinking of beds and red cheeks , and of course i kept thinking of sex when i looked at him , and i thought , is that what he 's thinking about ? and i thought , if i 'm going to make a story , what 's the last thing i 'm going to put in there ? well , what would a tudor gentleman be preoccupied with ? and i thought , well , henry viii , okay . he 'd be preoccupied with his inheritance , with his heir . who is going to inherit his name and his fortune ? you put all those together , and you 've got your story to fill in that gap that makes you keep coming back . now , here 's the story . it 's short . " rosy " i am still wearing the white brocade doublet caroline gave me . it has a plain high collar , detachable sleeves and intricate buttons of twisted silk thread , set close together so that the fit is snug . the doublet makes me think of a coverlet on the vast bed . perhaps that was the intention . i first wore it at an elaborate dinner her parents held in our honor . i knew even before i stood up to speak that my cheeks were inflamed . i have always flushed easily , from physical exertion , from wine , from high emotion . as a boy , i was teased by my sisters and by schoolboys , but not by george . only george could call me rosy . i would not allow anyone else . he managed to make the word tender . when i made the announcement , george did not turn rosy , but went pale as my doublet . he should not have been surprised . it has been a common assumption that i would one day marry his cousin . but it is difficult to hear the words aloud . i know , i could barely utter them . afterwards , i found george on the terrace overlooking the kitchen garden . despite drinking steadily all afternoon , he was still pale . we stood together and watched the maids cut lettuces . " what do you think of my doublet ? " i asked . he glanced at me . " that collar looks to be strangling you . " " we will still see each other , " i insisted . " we can still hunt and play cards and attend court . nothing need change . " george did not speak . " i am 23 years old . it is time for me to marry and produce an heir . it is expected of me . " george drained another glass of claret and turned to me . " congratulations on your upcoming nuptials , james . i 'm sure you 'll be content together . " he never used my nickname again . thank you . thank you .
design	it 's time to start designing for our ears . architects and designers tend to focus exclusively on these . they use these to design with and they design for them , which is why we end up sitting in restaurants that look like this -- -- and sound like this , shouting from a foot away to try and be heard by our dinner companion , or why we get on airplanes -- -- which cost 200 million pounds , with somebody talking through an old - fashioned telephone handset on a cheap stereo system , making us jump out of our skins . we 're designing environments that make us crazy . and it 's not just our quality of life which suffers . it 's our health , our social behavior , and our productivity as well . how does this work ? well , two ways . first of all , ambience . i have a whole tedtalk about this . sound affects us physiologically , psychologically , cognitively and behaviorally all the time . the sound around us is affecting us even though we 're not conscious of it . there 's a second way though , as well . that 's interference . communication requires sending and receiving , and i have another whole tedtalk about the importance of conscious listening , but i can send as well as i like , and you can be brilliant conscious listeners . if the space i 'm sending it in is not effective , that communication ca n't happen . spaces tend to include noise and acoustics . a room like this has acoustics , this one very good acoustics . many rooms are not so good . let me give you some examples from a couple of areas which i think we all care about : health and education . when i was visiting my terminally ill father in a hospital , i was asking myself , how does anybody get well in a place that sounds like this ? hospital sound is getting worse all the time . noise levels in hospitals have doubled in the last few years , and it affects not just the patients but also the people working there . i think we would like for dispensing errors to be zero , would n't we ? and yet , as noise levels go up , so do the errors in dispensing made by the staff in hospitals . most of all , though , it affects the patients , and that could be you , it could be me . sleep is absolutely crucial for recovery . it 's when we regenerate , when we rebuild ourselves , and with threatening noise like this going on , your body , even if you are able to sleep , your body is telling you , " i 'm under threat . this is dangerous . " and the quality of sleep is degraded , and so is our recovery . there are just huge benefits to come from designing for the ears in our health care . this is an area i intend to take on this year . education . when i see a classroom that looks like this , can you imagine how this sounds ? i am forced to ask myself a question . now , that 's a little unfair . some of my best friends are architects . and they definitely do have ears . but i think sometimes they do n't use them when they 're designing buildings . here 's a case in point . this is a 32 - million - pound flagship academy school which was built quite recently in the u.k. and designed by one of britain 's top architects . unfortunately , it was designed like a corporate headquarters , with a vast central atrium and classrooms leading off it with no back walls at all . the children could n't hear their teachers . they had to go back in and spend 600,000 pounds putting the walls in . let 's stop this madness of open plan classrooms right now , please . it 's not just these modern buildings which suffer . old - fashioned classrooms suffer too . a study in florida just a few years ago found that if you 're sitting where this photograph was taken in the classroom , row four , speech intelligibility is just 50 percent . children are losing one word in two . now that does n't mean they only get half their education , but it does mean they have to work very hard to join the dots and understand what 's going on . this is affected massively by reverberation time , how reverberant a room is . in a classroom with a reverberation time of 1.2 seconds , which is pretty common , this is what it sounds like . not so good , is it ? if you take that 1.2 seconds down to 0.4 seconds by installing acoustic treatments , sound absorbing materials and so forth , this is what you get . voice : in language , infinitely many words can be written with a small set of letters . in arithmetic , infinitely many numbers can be composed from just a few digits with the help of the simple zero . julian treasure : what a difference . now that education you would receive , and thanks to the british acoustician adrian james for those simulations . the signal was the same , the background noise was the same . all that changed was the acoustics of the classroom in those two examples . if education can be likened to watering a garden , which is a fair metaphor , sadly , much of the water is evaporating before it reaches the flowers , especially for some groups , for example , those with hearing impairment . now that 's not just deaf children . that could be any child who 's got a cold , glue ear , an ear infection , even hay fever . on a given day , one in eight children fall into that group , on any given day . then you have children for whom english is a second language , or whatever they 're being taught in is a second language . in the u.k. , that 's more than 10 percent of the school population . and finally , after susan cain 's wonderful tedtalk in february , we know that introverts find it very difficult to relate when they 're in a noisy environment doing group work . add those up . that is a lot of children who are not receiving their education properly . it 's not just the children who are affected , though . this study in germany found the average noise level in classrooms is 65 decibels . i have to really raise my voice to talk over 65 decibels of sound , and teachers are not just raising their voices . this chart maps the teacher 's heart rate against the noise level . noise goes up , heart rate goes up . that is not good for you . in fact , 65 decibels is the very level at which this big survey of all the evidence on noise and health found that , that is the threshold for the danger of myocardial infarction . to you and me , that 's a heart attack . it may not be pushing the boat out too far to suggest that many teachers are losing significant life expectancy by teaching in environments like that day after day . what does it cost to treat a classroom down to that 0.4 - second reverberation time ? two and a half thousand pounds . and the essex study which has just been done in the u.k. , which incidentally showed that when you do this , you do not just make a room that 's suitable for hearing - impaired children , you make a room where behavior improves , and results improve significantly , this found that sending a child out of area to a school that does have such a room , if you do n't have one , costs 90,000 pounds a year . i think the economics are pretty clear on this . i 'm glad that debate is happening on this . i just moderated a major conference in london a few weeks ago called sound education , which brought together top acousticians , government people , teachers , and so forth . we 're at last starting to debate this issue , and the benefits that are available for designing for the ears in education , unbelievable . out of that conference , incidentally , also came a free app which is designed to help children study if they 're having to work at home , for example , in a noisy kitchen . and that 's free out of that conference . let 's broaden the perspective a little bit and look at cities . we have urban planners . where are the urban sound planners ? i do n't know of one in the world , and the opportunity is there to transform our experience in our cities . the world health organization estimates that a quarter of europe 's population is having its sleep degraded by noise in cities . we can do better than that . and in our offices , we spend a lot of time at work . where are the office sound planners ? people who say , do n't sit that team next to this team , because they like noise and they need quiet . or who say , do n't spend all your budget on a huge screen in the conference room , and then place one tiny microphone in the middle of a table for 30 people . if you can hear me , you can understand me without seeing me . if you can see me without hearing me , that does not work . so office sound is a huge area , and incidentally , noise in offices has been shown to make people less helpful , less enjoy their teamwork , and less productive at work . finally , we have homes . we use interior designers . where are the interior sound designers ? hey , let 's all be interior sound designers , take on listening to our rooms and designing sound that 's effective and appropriate . my friend richard mazuch , an architect in london , coined the phrase " invisible architecture . " i love that phrase . it 's about designing , not appearance , but experience , so that we have spaces that sound as good as they look , that are fit for purpose , that improve our quality of life , our health and well being , our social behavior and our productivity . it 's time to start designing for the ears . thank you . thank you .
global	this is how war starts . one day you 're living your ordinary life , you 're planning to go to a party , you 're taking your children to school , you 're making a dentist appointment . the next thing , the telephones go out , the tvs go out , there 's armed men on the street , there 's roadblocks . your life as you know it goes into suspended animation . it stops . i 'm going to steal a story from a friend of mine , a bosnian friend , about what happened to her , because i think it will illustrate for you exactly what it feels like . she was walking to work one day in april , 1992 , in a miniskirt and high heels . she worked in a bank . she was a young mother . she was someone who liked to party . great person . and suddenly she sees a tank ambling down the main road of sarajevo knocking everything out of its path . she thinks she 's dreaming , but she 's not . and she runs as any of us would have done and takes cover , and she hides behind a trash bin , in her high heels and her miniskirt . and as she 's hiding there , she 's feeling ridiculous , but she 's seeing this tank go by with soldiers and people all over the place and chaos and she thinks , " i feel like alice in wonderland going down the rabbit hole , down , down , down into chaos , and my life will never be the same again . " a few weeks later , my friend was in a crowd of people pushing with her infant son in her arms to give him to a stranger on a bus , which was one of the last buses leaving sarajevo to take children out so they could be safe . and she remembers struggling with her mother to the front , crowds and crowds of people , " take my child ! take my child ! " and passing her son to someone through a window . and she did n't see him for years . the siege went on for three and a half years , and it was a siege without water , without power , without electricity , without heat , without food , in the middle of europe , in the middle of the 20th century . i had the honor of being one of those reporters that lived through that siege , and i say i have the honor and the privilege of being there because it 's taught me everything , not just about being a reporter , but about being a human being . i learned about compassion . i learned about ordinary people who could be heroes . i learned about sharing . i learned about camaraderie . most of all , i learned about love . even in the midst of terrible destruction and death and chaos , i learned how ordinary people could help their neighbors , share food , raise their children , drag someone who 's being sniped at from the middle of the road even though you yourself were endangering your life , helping people get into taxis who were injured to try to take them to hospitals . i learned so much about myself . martha gellhorn , who 's one of my heroes , once said , " you can only love one war . the rest is responsibility . " i went on to cover many , many , many wars after that , so many that i lost count , but there was nothing like sarajevo . last april , i went back to a very strange -- what i called a deranged high school reunion . what it was , was the 20th anniversary of the siege , the beginning of the siege of sarajevo , and i do n't like the word " anniversary , " because it sounds like a party , and this was not a party . it was a very somber gathering of the reporters that worked there during the war , humanitarian aid workers , and of course the brave and courageous people of sarajevo themselves . and the thing that struck me the most , that broke my heart , was walking down the main street of sarajevo , where my friend aida saw the tank coming 20 years ago , and in that road were more than 12,000 red chairs , empty , and every single one of them symbolized a person who had died during the siege , just in sarajevo , not in all of bosnia , and it stretched from one end of the city to a large part of it , and the saddest for me were the tiny little chairs for the children . i now cover syria , and i started reporting it because i believed that it needs to be done . i believe a story there has to be told . i see , again , a template of the war in bosnia . and when i first arrived in damascus , i saw this strange moment where people did n't seem to believe that war was going to descend , and it was exactly the same in bosnia and nearly every other country i 've seen where war comes . people do n't want to believe it 's coming , so they do n't leave , they do n't leave before they can . they do n't get their money out . they stay because you want to stay in your home . and then war and chaos descend . rwanda is a place that haunts me a lot . in 1994 , i briefly left sarajevo to go report the genocide in rwanda . between april and august , 1994 , one million people were slaughtered . now if those 12,000 chairs freaked me out with the sheer number , i want you just for a second to think of a million people . and to give you some example , i remember standing and looking down a road as far as i could see , at least a mile , and there were bodies piled twice my height of the dead . and that was just a small percentage of the dead . and there were mothers holding their children who had been caught in their last death throes . so we learn a lot from war , and i mention rwanda because it is one place , like south africa , where nearly 20 years on , there is healing . fifty - six percent of the parliamentarians are women , which is fantastic , and there 's also within the national constitution now , you 're actually not allowed to say hutu or tutsi . you 're not allowed to identify anyone by ethnicity , which is , of course , what started the slaughter in the first place . and an aid worker friend of mine told me the most beautiful story , or i find it beautiful . there was a group of children , mixed hutus and tutsis , and a group of women who were adopting them , and they lined up and one was just given to the next . there was no kind of compensation for , you 're a tutsi , you 're a hutu , you might have killed my mother , you might have killed my father . they were just brought together in this kind of reconciliation , and i find this remarkable . so when people ask me how i continue to cover war , and why i continue to do it , this is why . when i go back to syria , next week in fact , what i see is incredibly heroic people , some of them fighting for democracy , for things we take for granted every single day . and that 's pretty much why i do it . in 2004 , i had a little baby boy , and i call him my miracle child , because after seeing so much death and destruction and chaos and darkness in my life , this ray of hope was born . and i called him luca , which means " the bringer of light , " because he does bring light to my life . but i 'm talking about him because when he was four months old , my foreign editor forced me to go back to baghdad where i had been reporting all throughout the saddam regime and during the fall of baghdad and afterwards , and i remember getting on the plane in tears , crying to be separated from my son , and while i was there , a quite famous iraqi politician who was a friend of mine said to me , " what are you doing here ? why are n't you home with luca ? " and i said , " well , i have to see . " it was 2004 which was the beginning of the incredibly bloody time in iraq , " i have to see , i have to see what is happening here . i have to report it . " and he said , " go home , because if you miss his first tooth , if you miss his first step , you 'll never forgive yourself . but there will always be another war . " and there , sadly , will always be wars . and i am deluding myself if i think , as a journalist , as a reporter , as a writer , what i do can stop them . i ca n't . i 'm not kofi annan . he ca n't stop a war . he tried to negotiate syria and could n't do it . i 'm not a u.n. conflict resolution person . i 'm not even a humanitarian aid doctor , and i ca n't tell you the times of how helpless i 've felt to have people dying in front of me , and i could n't save them . all i am is a witness . my role is to bring a voice to people who are voiceless . a colleague of mine described it as to shine a light in the darkest corners of the world . and that 's what i try to do . i 'm not always successful , and sometimes it 's incredibly frustrating , because you feel like you 're writing into a void , or you feel like no one cares . who cares about syria ? who cares about bosnia ? who cares about the congo , the ivory coast , liberia , sierra leone , all of these strings of places that i will remember for the rest of my life ? but my métier is to bear witness and that is the crux , the heart of the matter , for us reporters who do this . and all i can really do is hope , not to policymakers or politicians , because as much as i 'd like to have faith that they read my words and do something , i do n't delude myself . but what i do hope is that if you remember anything i said or any of my stories tomorrow morning over breakfast , if you can remember the story of sarajevo , or the story of rwanda , then i 've done my job . thank you very much .
science	hi . so , this chap here , he thinks he can tell you the future . his name is nostradamus , although here the sun have made him look a little bit like sean connery . and like most of you , i suspect , i do n't really believe that people can see into the future . i do n't believe in precognition , and every now and then , you hear that somebody has been able to predict something that happened in the future , and that 's probably because it was a fluke , and we only hear about the flukes and about the freaks . we do n't hear about all the times that people got stuff wrong . now we expect that to happen with silly stories about precognition , but the problem is , we have exactly the same problem in academia and in medicine , and in this environment , it costs lives . so firstly , thinking just about precognition , as it turns out , just last year a researcher called daryl bem conducted a piece of research where he found evidence of precognitive powers in undergraduate students , and this was published in a peer - reviewed academic journal and most of the people who read this just said , " okay , well , fair enough , but i think that 's a fluke , that 's a freak , because i know that if i did a study where i found no evidence that undergraduate students had precognitive powers , it probably would n't get published in a journal . and in fact , we know that that 's true , because several different groups of research scientists tried to replicate the findings of this precognition study , and when they submitted it to the exact same journal , the journal said , " no , we 're not interested in publishing replication . we 're not interested in your negative data . " so this is already evidence of how , in the academic literature , we will see a biased sample of the true picture of all of the scientific studies that have been conducted . but it does n't just happen in the dry academic field of psychology . it also happens in , for example , cancer research . so in march , 2012 , just one month ago , some researchers reported in the journal nature how they had tried to replicate 53 different basic science studies looking at potential treatment targets in cancer , and out of those 53 studies , they were only able to successfully replicate six . forty - seven out of those 53 were unreplicable . and they say in their discussion that this is very likely because freaks get published . people will do lots and lots and lots of different studies , and the occasions when it works they will publish , and the ones where it does n't work they wo n't . and their first recommendation of how to fix this problem , because it is a problem , because it sends us all down blind alleys , their first recommendation of how to fix this problem is to make it easier to publish negative results in science , and to change the incentives so that scientists are encouraged to post more of their negative results in public . but it does n't just happen in the very dry world of preclinical basic science cancer research . it also happens in the very real , flesh and blood of academic medicine . so in 1980 , some researchers did a study on a drug called lorcainide , and this was an anti - arrhythmic drug , a drug that suppresses abnormal heart rhythms , and the idea was , after people have had a heart attack , they 're quite likely to have abnormal heart rhythms , so if we give them a drug that suppresses abnormal heart rhythms , this will increase the chances of them surviving . early on its development , they did a very small trial , just under a hundred patients . fifty patients got lorcainide , and of those patients , 10 died . another 50 patients got a dummy placebo sugar pill with no active ingredient , and only one of them died . so they rightly regarded this drug as a failure , and its commercial development was stopped , and because its commercial development was stopped , this trial was never published . unfortunately , over the course of the next five , 10 years , other companies had the same idea about drugs that would prevent arrhythmias in people who have had heart attacks . these drugs were brought to market . they were prescribed very widely because heart attacks are a very common thing , and it took so long for us to find out that these drugs also caused an increased rate of death that before we detected that safety signal , over 100,000 people died unnecessarily in america from the prescription of anti - arrhythmic drugs . now actually , in 1993 , the researchers who did that 1980 study , that early study , published a mea culpa , an apology to the scientific community , in which they said , " when we carried out our study in 1980 , we thought that the increased death rate that occurred in the lorcainide group was an effect of chance . " the development of lorcainide was abandoned for commercial reasons , and this study was never published ; it 's now a good example of publication bias . that 's the technical term for the phenomenon where unflattering data gets lost , gets unpublished , is left missing in action , and they say the results described here " might have provided an early warning of trouble ahead . " now these are stories from basic science . these are stories from 20 , 30 years ago . the academic publishing environment is very different now . there are academic journals like " trials , " the open access journal , which will publish any trial conducted in humans regardless of whether it has a positive or a negative result . but this problem of negative results that go missing in action is still very prevalent . in fact it 's so prevalent that it cuts to the core of evidence - based medicine . so this is a drug called reboxetine , and this is a drug that i myself have prescribed . it 's an antidepressant . and i 'm a very nerdy doctor , so i read all of the studies that i could on this drug . i read the one study that was published that showed that reboxetine was better than placebo , and i read the other three studies that were published that showed that reboxetine was just as good as any other antidepressant , and because this patient had n't done well on those other antidepressants , i thought , well , reboxetine is just as good . it 's one to try . but it turned out that i was misled . in fact , seven trials were conducted comparing reboxetine against a dummy placebo sugar pill . one of them was positive and that was published , but six of them were negative and they were left unpublished . three trials were published comparing reboxetine against other antidepressants in which reboxetine was just as good , and they were published , but three times as many patients ' worth of data was collected which showed that reboxetine was worse than those other treatments , and those trials were not published . i felt misled . now you might say , well , that 's an extremely unusual example , and i would n't want to be guilty of the same kind of cherry - picking and selective referencing that i 'm accusing other people of . but it turns out that this phenomenon of publication bias has actually been very , very well studied . so here is one example of how you approach it . the classic model is , you get a bunch of studies where you know that they 've been conducted and completed , and then you go and see if they 've been published anywhere in the academic literature . so this took all of the trials that had ever been conducted on antidepressants that were approved over a 15 - year period by the fda . they took all of the trials which were submitted to the fda as part of the approval package . so that 's not all of the trials that were ever conducted on these drugs , because we can never know if we have those , but it is the ones that were conducted in order to get the marketing authorization . and then they went to see if these trials had been published in the peer - reviewed academic literature . and this is what they found . it was pretty much a 50-50 split . half of these trials were positive , half of them were negative , in reality . but when they went to look for these trials in the peer - reviewed academic literature , what they found was a very different picture . only three of the negative trials were published , but all but one of the positive trials were published . now if we just flick back and forth between those two , you can see what a staggering difference there was between reality and what doctors , patients , commissioners of health services , and academics were able to see in the peer - reviewed academic literature . we were misled , and this is a systematic flaw in the core of medicine . in fact , there have been so many studies conducted on publication bias now , over a hundred , that they 've been collected in a systematic review , published in 2010 , that took every single study on publication bias that they could find . publication bias affects every field of medicine . about half of all trials , on average , go missing in action , and we know that positive findings are around twice as likely to be published as negative findings . this is a cancer at the core of evidence - based medicine . if i flipped a coin 100 times but then withheld the results from you from half of those tosses , i could make it look as if i had a coin that always came up heads . but that would n't mean that i had a two - headed coin . that would mean that i was a chancer and you were an idiot for letting me get away with it . but this is exactly what we blindly tolerate in the whole of evidence - based medicine . and to me , this is research misconduct . if i conducted one study and i withheld half of the data points from that one study , you would rightly accuse me , essentially , of research fraud . and yet , for some reason , if somebody conducts 10 studies but only publishes the five that give the result that they want , we do n't consider that to be research misconduct . and when that responsibility is diffused between a whole network of researchers , academics , industry sponsors , journal editors , for some reason we find it more acceptable , but the effect on patients is damning . and this is happening right now , today . this is a drug called tamiflu . tamiflu is a drug which governments around the world have spent billions and billions of dollars on stockpiling , and we 've stockpiled tamiflu in panic , in the belief that it will reduce the rate of complications of influenza . complications is a medical euphemism for pneumonia and death . now when the cochrane systematic reviewers were trying to collect together all of the data from all of the trials that had ever been conducted on whether tamiflu actually did this or not , they found that several of those trials were unpublished . the results were unavailable to them . and when they started obtaining the writeups of those trials through various different means , through freedom of information act requests , through harassing various different organizations , what they found was inconsistent . and when they tried to get a hold of the clinical study reports , the 10,000 - page long documents that have the best possible rendition of the information , they were told they were n't allowed to have them . and if you want to read the full correspondence and the excuses and the explanations given by the drug company , you can see that written up in this week 's edition of plos medicine . and the most staggering thing of all of this , to me , is that not only is this a problem , not only do we recognize that this is a problem , but we 've had to suffer fake fixes . we 've had people pretend that this is a problem that 's been fixed . first of all , we had trials registers , and everybody said , oh , it 's okay . we 'll get everyone to register their trials , they 'll post the protocol , they 'll say what they 're going to do before they do it , and then afterwards we 'll be able to check and see if all the trials which have been conducted and completed have been published . but people did n't bother to use those registers . and so then the international committee of medical journal editors came along , and they said , oh , well , we will hold the line . we wo n't publish any journals , we wo n't publish any trials , unless they 've been registered before they began . but they did n't hold the line . in 2008 , a study was conducted which showed that half of all of trials published by journals edited by members of the icmje were n't properly registered , and a quarter of them were n't registered at all . and then finally , the fda amendment act was passed a couple of years ago saying that everybody who conducts a trial must post the results of that trial within one year . and in the bmj , in the first edition of january , 2012 , you can see a study which looks to see if people kept to that ruling , and it turns out that only one in five have done so . this is a disaster . we cannot know the true effects of the medicines that we prescribe if we do not have access to all of the information . and this is not a difficult problem to fix . we need to force people to publish all trials conducted in humans , including the older trials , because the fda amendment act only asks that you publish the trials conducted after 2008 , and i do n't know what world it is in which we 're only practicing medicine on the basis of trials that completed in the past two years . we need to publish all trials in humans , including the older trials , for all drugs in current use , and you need to tell everyone you know that this is a problem and that it has not been fixed . thank you very much .
science biology	this is the natural history museum in rotterdam , where i work as a curator . it 's my job to make sure the collection stays okay , and that it grows , and basically it means i collect dead animals . back in 1995 , we got a new wing next to the museum . it was made of glass , and this building really helped me to do my job good . the building was a true bird - killer . you may know that birds do n't understand the concept of glass . they do n't see it , so they fly into the windows and get killed . the only thing i had to do was go out , pick them up , and have them stuffed for the collection . and in those days , i developed an ear to identify birds just by the sound of the bangs they made against the glass . and it was on june 5 , 1995 , that i heard a loud bang against the glass that changed my life and ended that of a duck . and this is what i saw when i looked out of the window . this is the dead duck . it flew against the window . it 's laying dead on its belly . but next to the dead duck is a live duck , and please pay attention . both are of the male sex . and then this happened . the live duck mounted the dead duck , and started to copulate . well , i 'm a biologist . i 'm an ornithologist . i said , " something 's wrong here . " one is dead , one is alive . that must be necrophilia . i look . both are of the male sex . homosexual necrophilia . so i -- i took my camera , i took my notebook , took a chair , and started to observe this behavior . after 75 minutes -- -- i had seen enough , and i got hungry , and i wanted to go home . so i went out , collected the duck , and before i put it in the freezer , i checked if the victim was indeed of the male sex . and here 's a rare picture of a duck 's penis , so it was indeed of the male sex . it 's a rare picture because there are 10,000 species of birds and only 300 possess a penis . [ the first case of homosexual necrophilia in the mallard anas platyrhynchos ] i knew i 'd seen something special , but it took me six years to decide to publish it . i mean , it 's a nice topic for a birthday party or at the coffee machine , but to share this among your peers is something different . i did n't have the framework . so after six years , my friends and colleagues urged me to publish , so i published " the first case of homosexual necrophilia in the mallard . " and here 's the situation again . a is my office , b is the place where the duck hit the glass , and c is from where i watched it . and here are the ducks again . as you probably know , in science , when you write a kind of special paper , only six or seven people read it . but then something good happened . i got a phone call from a person called marc abrahams , and he told me , " you 've won a prize with your duck paper : the ig nobel prize . " and the ig nobel prize -- -- the ig nobel prize honors research that first makes people laugh , and then makes them think , with the ultimate goal to make more people interested in science . that 's a good thing , so i accepted the prize . i went -- let me remind you that marc abrahams did n't call me from stockholm . he called me from cambridge , massachusetts . so i traveled to boston , to cambridge , and i went to this wonderful ig nobel prize ceremony held at harvard university , and this ceremony is a very nice experience . real nobel laureates hand you the prize . that 's the first thing . and there are nine other winners who get prizes . here 's one of my fellow winners . that 's charles paxton who won the 2000 biology prize for his paper , " courtship behavior of ostriches towards humans under farming conditions in britain . " and i think there are one or two more ig nobel prize winners in this room . dan , where are you ? dan ariely ? applause for dan . dan won his prize in medicine for demonstrating that high - priced fake medicine works better than low - priced fake medicine . so here 's my one minute of fame , my acceptance speech , and here 's the duck . this is its first time on the u.s. west coast . i 'm going to pass it around . yeah ? you can pass it around . please note it 's a museum specimen , but there 's no chance you 'll get the avian flu . after winning this prize , my life changed . in the first place , people started to send me all kinds of duck - related things , and i got a real nice collection . more importantly , people started to send me their observations of remarkable animal behavior , and believe me , if there 's an animal misbehaving on this planet , i know about it . this is a moose . it 's a moose trying to copulate with a bronze statue of a bison . this is in montana , 2008 . this is a frog that tries to copulate with a goldfish . this is the netherlands , 2011 . these are cane toads in australia . this is roadkill . please note that this is necrophilia . it 's remarkable : the position . the missionary position is very rare in the animal kingdom . these are pigeons in rotterdam . barn swallows in hong kong , 2004 . this is a turkey in wisconsin on the premises of the ethan allen juvenile correctional institution . it took all day , and the prisoners had a great time . so what does this mean ? i mean , the question i ask myself , why does this happen in nature ? well , what i concluded from reviewing all these cases is that it is important that this happens only when death is instant and in a dramatic way and in the right position for copulation . at least , i thought it was till i got these slides . and here you see a dead duck . it 's been there for three days , and it 's laying on its back . so there goes my theory of necrophilia . another example of the impact of glass buildings on the life of birds . this is mad max , a blackbird who lives in rotterdam . the only thing this bird did was fly against this window from 2004 to 2008 , day in and day out . here he goes , and here 's a short video . so what this bird does is fight his own image . he sees an intruder in his territory , and it 's coming all the time and he 's there , so there is no end to it . and i thought , in the beginning -- i studied this bird for a couple of years -- that , well , should n't the brain of this bird be damaged ? it 's not . i show you here some slides , some frames from the video , and at the last moment before he hits the glass , he puts his feet in front , and then he bangs against the glass . so i 'll conclude to invite you all to dead duck day . that 's on june 5 every year . at five minutes to six in the afternoon , we come together at the natural history museum in rotterdam , the duck comes out of the museum , and we try to discuss new ways to prevent birds from colliding with windows . and as you know , or as you may not know , this is one of the major causes of death for birds in the world . in the u.s. alone , a billion birds die in collision with glass buildings . and when it 's over , we go to a chinese restaurant and we have a six - course duck dinner . so i hope to see you next year in rotterdam , the netherlands , for dead duck day . thank you . oh , sorry . may i have my duck back , please ? thank you .
global business economics	" when the crisis came , the serious limitations of existing economic and financial models immediately became apparent . " " there is also a strong belief , which i share , that bad or oversimplistic and overconfident economics helped create the crisis . " now , you 've probably all heard of similar criticism coming from people who are skeptical of capitalism . but this is different . this is coming from the heart of finance . the first quote is from jean - claude trichet when he was governor of the european central bank . the second quote is from the head of the u.k. financial services authority . are these people implying that we do n't understand the economic systems that drive our modern societies ? it gets worse . " we spend billions of dollars trying to understand the origins of the universe while we still do n't understand the conditions for a stable society , a functioning economy , or peace . " what 's happening here ? how can this be possible ? do we really understand more about the fabric of reality than we do about the fabric which emerges from our human interactions ? unfortunately , the answer is yes . but there 's an intriguing solution which is coming from what is known as the science of complexity . to explain what this means and what this thing is , please let me quickly take a couple of steps back . i ended up in physics by accident . it was a random encounter when i was young , and since then , i 've often wondered about the amazing success of physics in describing the reality we wake up in every day . in a nutshell , you can think of physics as follows . so you take a chunk of reality you want to understand and you translate it into mathematics . you encode it into equations . then predictions can be made and tested . we 're actually really lucky that this works , because no one really knows why the thoughts in our heads should actually relate to the fundamental workings of the universe . despite the success , physics has its limits . as dirk helbing pointed out in the last quote , we do n't really understand the complexity that relates to us , that surrounds us . this paradox is what got me interested in complex systems . so these are systems which are made up of many interconnected or interacting parts : swarms of birds or fish , ant colonies , ecosystems , brains , financial markets . these are just a few examples . interestingly , complex systems are very hard to map into mathematical equations , so the usual physics approach does n't really work here . so what do we know about complex systems ? well , it turns out that what looks like complex behavior from the outside is actually the result of a few simple rules of interaction . this means you can forget about the equations and just start to understand the system by looking at the interactions , so you can actually forget about the equations and you just start to look at the interactions . and it gets even better , because most complex systems have this amazing property called emergence . so this means that the system as a whole suddenly starts to show a behavior which cannot be understood or predicted by looking at the components of the system . so the whole is literally more than the sum of its parts . and all of this also means that you can forget about the individual parts of the system , how complex they are . so if it 's a cell or a termite or a bird , you just focus on the rules of interaction . as a result , networks are ideal representations of complex systems . the nodes in the network are the system 's components and the links are given by the interactions . so what equations are for physics , complex networks are for the study of complex systems . this approach has been very successfully applied to many complex systems in physics , biology , computer science , the social sciences , but what about economics ? where are economic networks ? this is a surprising and prominent gap in the literature . the study we published last year called " the network of global corporate control " was the first extensive analysis of economic networks . the study went viral on the internet and it attracted a lot of attention from the international media . this is quite remarkable , because , again , why did no one look at this before ? similar data has been around for quite some time . what we looked at in detail was ownership networks . so here the nodes are companies , people , governments , foundations , etc. and the links represent the shareholding relations , so shareholder a has x percent of the shares in company b. and we also assign a value to the company given by the operating revenue . so ownership networks reveal the patterns of shareholding relations . in this little example , you can see a few financial institutions with some of the many links highlighted . now you may think that no one 's looked at this before because ownership networks are really , really boring to study . well , as ownership is related to control , as i shall explain later , looking at ownership networks actually can give you answers to questions like , who are the key players ? how are they organized ? are they isolated ? are they interconnected ? and what is the overall distribution of control ? in other words , who controls the world ? i think this is an interesting question . and it has implications for systemic risk . this is a measure of how vulnerable a system is overall . a high degree of interconnectivity can be bad for stability , because then the stress can spread through the system like an epidemic . scientists have sometimes criticized economists who believe ideas and concepts are more important than empirical data , because a foundational guideline in science is : let the data speak . okay . let 's do that . so we started with a database containing 13 million ownership relations from 2007 . this is a lot of data , and because we wanted to find out who rules the world , we decided to focus on transnational corporations , or tncs for short . these are companies that operate in more than one country , and we found 43,000 . in the next step , we built the network around these companies , so we took all the tncs ' shareholders , and the shareholders ' shareholders , etc. , all the way upstream , and we did the same downstream , and ended up with a network containing 600,000 nodes and one million links . this is the tnc network which we analyzed . and it turns out to be structured as follows . so you have a periphery and a center which contains about 75 percent of all the players , and in the center there 's this tiny but dominant core which is made up of highly interconnected companies . to give you a better picture , think about a metropolitan area . so you have the suburbs and the periphery , you have a center like a financial district , then the core will be something like the tallest high rise building in the center . and we already see signs of organization going on here . thirty - six percent of the tncs are in the core only , but they make up 95 percent of the total operating revenue of all tncs . okay , so now we analyzed the structure , so how does this relate to the control ? well , ownership gives voting rights to shareholders . this is the normal notion of control . and there are different models which allow you to compute the control you get from ownership . if you have more than 50 percent of the shares in a company , you get control , but usually it depends on the relative distribution of shares . and the network really matters . about 10 years ago , mr. tronchetti provera had ownership and control in a small company , which had ownership and control in a bigger company . you get the idea . this ended up giving him control in telecom italia with a leverage of 26 . so this means that , with each euro he invested , he was able to move 26 euros of market value through the chain of ownership relations . now what we actually computed in our study was the control over the tncs ' value . this allowed us to assign a degree of influence to each shareholder . this is very much in the sense of max weber 's idea of potential power , which is the probability of imposing one 's own will despite the opposition of others . if you want to compute the flow in an ownership network , this is what you have to do . it 's actually not that hard to understand . let me explain by giving you this analogy . so think about water flowing in pipes where the pipes have different thickness . so similarly , the control is flowing in the ownership networks and is accumulating at the nodes . so what did we find after computing all this network control ? well , it turns out that the 737 top shareholders have the potential to collectively control 80 percent of the tncs ' value . now remember , we started out with 600,000 nodes , so these 737 top players make up a bit more than 0.1 percent . they 're mostly financial institutions in the u.s. and the u.k. and it gets even more extreme . there are 146 top players in the core , and they together have the potential to collectively control 40 percent of the tncs ' value . what should you take home from all of this ? well , the high degree of control you saw is very extreme by any standard . the high degree of interconnectivity of the top players in the core could pose a significant systemic risk to the global economy and we could easily reproduce the tnc network with a few simple rules . this means that its structure is probably the result of self - organization . it 's an emergent property which depends on the rules of interaction in the system , so it 's probably not the result of a top - down approach like a global conspiracy . our study " is an impression of the moon 's surface . it 's not a street map . " so you should take the exact numbers in our study with a grain of salt , yet it " gave us a tantalizing glimpse of a brave new world of finance . " we hope to have opened the door for more such research in this direction , so the remaining unknown terrain will be charted in the future . and this is slowly starting . we 're seeing the emergence of long - term and highly - funded programs which aim at understanding our networked world from a complexity point of view . but this journey has only just begun , so we will have to wait before we see the first results . now there is still a big problem , in my opinion . ideas relating to finance , economics , politics , society , are very often tainted by people 's personal ideologies . i really hope that this complexity perspective allows for some common ground to be found . it would be really great if it has the power to help end the gridlock created by conflicting ideas , which appears to be paralyzing our globalized world . reality is so complex , we need to move away from dogma . but this is just my own personal ideology . thank you .
culture	across europe and central asia , approximately one million children live in large residential institutions , usually known as orphanages . most people imagine orphanages as a benign environment that care for children . others know more about the living conditions there , but still think they 're a necessary evil . after all , where else would we put all of those children who do n't have any parents ? but 60 years of research has demonstrated that separating children from their families and placing them in large institutions seriously harms their health and development , and this is particularly true for young babies . as we know , babies are born without their full muscle development , and that includes the brain . during the first three years of life , the brain grows to its full size , with most of that growth taking place in the first six months . the brain develops in response to experience and to stimulation . every time a young baby learns something new -- to focus its eyes , to mimic a movement or a facial expression , to pick something up , to form a word or to sit up -- new synaptic connections are being built in the brain . new parents are astonished by the rapidity of this learning . they are quite rightly amazed and delighted by their children 's cleverness . they communicate their delight to their children , who respond with smiles , and a desire to achieve more and to learn more . this forming of the powerful attachment between child and parent provides the building blocks for physical , social , language , cognitive and psychomotor development . it is the model for all future relationships with friends , with partners and with their own children . it happens so naturally in most families that we do n't even notice it . most of us are unaware of its importance to human development and , by extension , to the development of a healthy society . and it 's only when it goes wrong that we start to realize the importance of families to children . in august , 1993 , i had my first opportunity to witness on a massive scale the impact on children of institutionalization and the absence of parenting . those of us who remember the newspaper reports that came out of romania after the 1989 revolution will recall the horrors of the conditions in some of those institutions . i was asked to help the director of a large institution to help prevent the separation of children from their families . housing 550 babies , this was ceausescu 's show orphanage , and so i 'd been told the conditions were much better . having worked with lots of young children , i expected the institution to be a riot of noise , but it was as silent as a convent . it was hard to believe there were any children there at all , yet the director showed me into room after room , each containing row upon row of cots , in each of which lay a child staring into space . in a room of 40 newborns , not one of them was crying . yet i could see soiled nappies , and i could see that some of the children were distressed , but the only noise was a low , continuous moan . the head nurse told me proudly , " you see , our children are very well - behaved . " over the next few days , i began to realize that this quietness was not exceptional . the newly admitted babies would cry for the first few hours , but their demands were not met , and so eventually they learned not to bother . within a few days , they were listless , lethargic , and staring into space like all the others . over the years , many people and news reports have blamed the personnel in the institutions for the harm caused to the children , but often , one member of staff is caring for 10 , 20 , and even 40 children . hence they have no option but to implement a regimented program . the children must be woken at 7 and fed at 7:30 . at 8 , their nappies must be changed , so a staff member may have only 30 minutes to feed 10 or 20 children . if a child soils its nappy at 8:30 , he will have to wait several hours before it can be changed again . the child 's daily contact with another human being is reduced to a few hurried minutes of feeding and changing , and otherwise their only stimulation is the ceiling , the walls or the bars of their cots . since my first visit to ceausescu 's institution , i 've seen hundreds of such places across 18 countries , from the czech republic to sudan . across all of these diverse lands and cultures , the institutions , and the child 's journey through them , is depressingly similar . lack of stimulation often leads to self - stimulating behaviors like hand - flapping , rocking back and forth , or aggression , and in some institutions , psychiatric drugs are used to control the behavior of these children , whilst in others , children are tied up to prevent them from harming themselves or others . these children are quickly labeled as having disabilities and transferred to another institution for children with disabilities . most of these children will never leave the institution again . for those without disabilities , at age three , they 're transferred to another institution , and at age seven , to yet another . segregated according to age and gender , they are arbitrarily separated from their siblings , often without even a chance to say goodbye . there 's rarely enough to eat . they are often hungry . the older children bully the little ones . they learn to survive . they learn to defend themselves , or they go under . when they leave the institution , they find it really difficult to cope and to integrate into society . in moldova , young women raised in institutions are 10 times more likely to be trafficked than their peers , and a russian study found that two years after leaving institutions , young adults , 20 percent of them had a criminal record , 14 percent were involved in prostitution , and 10 percent had taken their own lives . but why are there so many orphans in europe when there has n't been a great deal of war or disaster in recent years ? in fact , more than 95 percent of these children have living parents , and societies tend to blame these parents for abandoning these children , but research shows that most parents want their children , and that the primary drivers behind institutionalization are poverty , disability and ethnicity . many countries have not developed inclusive schools , and so even children with a very mild disability are sent away to a residential special school , at age six or seven . the institution may be hundreds of miles away from the family home . if the family 's poor , they find it difficult to visit , and gradually the relationship breaks down . behind each of the million children in institutions , there is usually a story of parents who are desperate and feel they 've run out of options , like natalia in moldova , who only had enough money to feed her baby , and so had to send her older son to the institution ; or desi , in bulgaria , who looked after her four children at home until her husband died , but then she had to go out to work full time , and with no support , felt she had no option but to place a child with disabilities in an institution ; or the countless young girls too terrified to tell their parents they 're pregnant , who leave their babies in a hospital ; or the new parents , the young couple who have just found out that their firstborn child has a disability , and instead of being provided with positive messages about their child 's potential , are told by the doctors , " forget her , leave her in the institution , go home and make a healthy one . " this state of affairs is neither necessary nor is it inevitable . every child has the right to a family , deserves and needs a family , and children are amazingly resilient . we find that if we get them out of institutions and into loving families early on , they recover their developmental delays , and go on to lead normal , happy lives . it 's also much cheaper to provide support to families than it is to provide institutions . one study suggests that a family support service costs 10 percent of an institutional placement , whilst good quality foster care costs usually about 30 percent . if we spend less on these children but on the right services , we can take the savings and reinvest them in high quality residential care for those few children with extremely complex needs . across europe , a movement is growing to shift the focus and transfer the resources from large institutions that provide poor quality care to community - based services that protect children from harm and allow them to develop to their full potential . when i first started to work in romania nearly 20 years ago , there were 200,000 children living in institutions , and more entering every day . now , there are less than 10,000 , and family support services are provided across the country . in moldova , despite extreme poverty and the terrible effects of the global financial crisis , the numbers of children in institutions has reduced by more than 50 percent in the last five years , and the resources are being redistributed to family support services and inclusive schools . many countries have developed national action plans for change . the european commission and other major donors are finding ways to divert money from institutions towards family support , empowering communities to look after their own children . but there is still much to be done to end the systematic institutionalization of children . awareness - raising is required at every level of society . people need to know the harm that institutions cause to children , and the better alternatives that exist . if we know people who are planning to support orphanages , we should convince them to support family services instead . together , this is the one form of child abuse that we could eradicate in our lifetime . thank you .
design technology art	i was one of those kids that , every time i got in the car , i basically had to roll down the window . it was usually too hot , too stuffy or just too smelly , and my father would not let us use the air conditioner . he said that it would overheat the engine . and you might remember , some of you , how the cars were back then , and it was a common problem of overheating . but it was also the signal that capped the use , or overuse , of energy - consuming devices . things have changed now . we have cars that we take across country . we blast the air conditioning the entire way , and we never experience overheating . so there 's no more signal for us to tell us to stop . great , right ? well , we have similar problems in buildings . in the past , before air conditioning , we had thick walls . the thick walls are great for insulation . it keeps the interior very cool during the summertime , and warm during the wintertime , and the small windows were also very good because it limited the amount of temperature transfer between the interior and exterior . then in about the 1930s , with the advent of plate glass , rolled steel and mass production , we were able to make floor - to - ceiling windows and unobstructed views , and with that came the irreversible reliance on mechanical air conditioning to cool our solar - heated spaces . over time , the buildings got taller and bigger , our engineering even better , so that the mechanical systems were massive . they require a huge amount of energy . they give off a lot of heat into the atmosphere , and for some of you may understand the heat island effect in cities , where the urban areas are much more warm than the adjacent rural areas , but we also have problems that , when we lose power , we ca n't open a window here , and so the buildings are uninhabitable and have to be made vacant until that air conditioning system can start up again . even worse , with our intention of trying to make buildings move towards a net - zero energy state , we ca n't do it just by making mechanical systems more and more efficient . we need to look for something else , and we 've gotten ourselves a little bit into a rut . so what do we do here ? how do we pull ourselves and dig us out of this hole that we 've dug ? if we look at biology , and many of you probably do n't know , i was a biology major before i went into architecture , the human skin is the organ that naturally regulates the temperature in the body , and it 's a fantastic thing . that 's the first line of defense for the body . it has pores , it has sweat glands , it has all these things that work together very dynamically and very efficiently , and so what i propose is that our building skins should be more similar to human skin , and by doing so can be much more dynamic , responsive and differentiated , depending on where it is . and this gets me back to my research . what i proposed first doing is looking at a different material palette to do that . i presently , or currently , work with smart materials , and a smart thermo - bimetal . first of all , i guess we call it smart because it requires no controls and it requires no energy , and that 's a very big deal for architecture . what it is , it 's a lamination of two different metals together . you can see that here by the different reflection on this side . and because it has two different coefficients of expansion , when heated , one side will expand faster than the other and result in a curling action . so in early prototypes i built these surfaces to try to see how the curl would react to temperature and possibly allow air to ventilate through the system , and in other prototypes did surfaces where the multiplicity of having these strips together can try to make bigger movement happen when also heated , and currently have this installation at the materials & applications gallery in silver lake , close by , and it 's there until august , if you want to see it . it 's called " bloom , " and the surface is made completely out of thermo - bimetal , and its intention is to make this canopy that does two things . one , it 's a sun - shading device , so that when the sun hits the surface , it constricts the amount of sun passing through , and in other areas , it 's a ventilating system , so that hot , trapped air underneath can actually move through and out when necessary . you can see here in this time - lapse video that the sun , as it moves across the surface , as well as the shade , each of the tiles moves individually . keep in mind , with the digital technology that we have today , this thing was made out of about 14,000 pieces and there 's no two pieces alike at all . every single one is different . and the great thing with that is the fact that we can calibrate each one to be very , very specific to its location , to the angle of the sun , and also how the thing actually curls . so this kind of proof of concept project has a lot of implications to actual future application in architecture , and in this case , here you see a house , that 's for a developer in china , and it 's actually a four - story glass box . it 's still with that glass box because we still want that visual access , but now it 's sheathed with this thermo - bimetal layer , it 's a screen that goes around it , and that layer can actually open and close as that sun moves around on that surface . in addition to that , it can also screen areas for privacy , so that it can differentiate from some of the public areas in the space during different times of day . and what it basically implies is that , in houses now , we do n't need drapes or shutters or blinds anymore because we can sheath the building with these things , as well as control the amount of air conditioning you need inside that building . i 'm also looking at trying to develop some building components for the market , and so here you see a pretty typical double - glazed window panel , and in that panel , between those two pieces of glass , that double - glazing , i 'm trying to work on making a thermo - bimetal pattern system so that when the sun hits that outside layer and heats that interior cavity , that thermo - bimetal will begin to curl , and what actually will happen then is it 'll start to block out the sun in certain areas of the building , and totally , if necessary . and so you can imagine , even in this application , that in a high - rise building where the panel systems go from floor to floor up to 30 , 40 floors , the entire surface could be differentiated at different times of day depending on how that sun moves across and hits that surface . and these are some later studies that i 'm working on right now that are on the boards , where you can see , in the bottom right - hand corner , with the red , it 's actually smaller pieces of thermometal , and it 's actually going to , we 're trying to make it move like cilia or eyelashes . this last project is also of components . the influence -- and if you have noticed , one of my spheres of influence is biology -- is from a grasshopper . and grasshoppers have a different kind of breathing system . they breathe through holes in their sides called spiracles , and they bring the air through and it moves through their system to cool them down , and so in this project , i 'm trying to look at how we can consider that in architecture too , how we can bring air through holes in the sides of a building . and so you see here some early studies of blocks , where those holes are actually coming through , and this is before the thermo - bimetal is applied , and this is after the bimetal is applied . sorry , it 's a little hard to see , but on the surfaces , you can see these red arrows . on the left , it 's when it 's cold and the thermo - bimetal is flat so it will constrict air from passing through the blocks , and on the right , the thermo - bimetal curls and allows that air to pass through , so those are two different components that i 'm working on , and again , it 's a completely different thing , because you can imagine that air could potentially be coming through the walls instead of opening windows . so i want to leave you with one last impression about the project , or this kind of work and using smart materials . when you 're tired of opening and closing those blinds day after day , when you 're on vacation and there 's no one there on the weekends to be turning off and on the controls , or when there 's a power outage , and you have no electricity to rely on , these thermo - bimetals will still be working tirelessly , efficiently and endlessly . thank you .
art	sydney . i had been waiting my whole life to get to sydney . i got to the airport , to the hotel , checked in , and , sitting there in the lobby , was a brochure for the sydney festival . i thumbed through it , and i came across a show called " minto : live . " the description read : " the suburban streets of minto become the stage for performances created by international artists in collaboration with the people of minto . " what was this place called minto ? sydney , as i would learn , is a city of suburbs , and minto lies southwest , about an hour away . i have to say , it was n't exactly what i had in mind for my first day down under . i mean , i 'd thought about the harbour bridge or bondi beach , but minto ? but still , i 'm a producer , and the lure of a site - specific theater project was more than i could resist . so , off i went into friday afternoon traffic , and i 'll never forget what i saw when i got there . for the performance , the audience walked around the neighborhood from house to house , and the residents , who were the performers , they came out of their houses , and they performed these autobiographical dances on their lawns , on their driveways . the show is a collaboration with a u.k. - based performance company called lone twin . lone twin had come to minto and worked with the residents , and they had created these dances . this australian - indian girl , she came out and started to dance on her front lawn , and her father peered out the window to see what all the noise and commotion was about , and he soon joined her . and he was followed by her little sister . and soon they were all dancing this joyous , exuberant dance right there on their lawn . and as i walked through the neighborhood , i was amazed and i was moved by the incredible sense of ownership this community clearly felt about this event . " minto : live " brought sydneysiders into dialogue with international artists , and really celebrated the diversity of sydney on its own terms . the sydney festival which produced " minto : live " i think represents a new kind of 21st - century arts festival . these festivals are radically open . they can transform cities and communities . to understand this , i think it kind of makes sense to look where we 've come from . modern arts festivals were born in the rubble of world war ii . civic leaders created these annual events to celebrate culture as the highest expression of the human spirit . in 1947 , the edinburgh festival was born and avignon was born and hundreds of others would follow in their wake . the work they did was very , very high art , and stars came along like laurie anderson and merce cunningham and robert lepage who made work for this circuit , and you had these seminal shows like " the mahabharata " and the monumental " einstein on the beach . " but as the decades passed , these festivals , they really became the establishment , and as the culture and capital accelerated , the internet brought us all together , high and low kind of disappeared , a new kind of festival emerged . the old festivals , they continued to thrive , but from brighton to rio to perth , something new was emerging , and these festivals were really different . they 're open , these festivals , because , like in minto , they understand that the dialogue between the local and the global is essential . they 're open because they ask the audience to be a player , a protagonist , a partner , rather than a passive spectator , and they 're open because they know that imagination cannot be contained in buildings , and so much of the work they do is site - specific or outdoor work . so , the new festival , it asks the audience to play an essential role in shaping the performance . companies like de la guarda , which i produce , and punchdrunk create these completely immersive experiences that put the audience at the center of the action , but the german performance company rimini protokoll takes this all to a whole new level . in a series of shows that includes " 100 percent vancouver , " " 100 percent berlin , " rimini protokoll makes shows that actually reflect society . rimini protokoll chooses 100 people that represent that city at that moment in terms of race and gender and class , through a careful process that begins three months before , and then those 100 people share stories about themselves and their lives , and the whole thing becomes a snapshot of that city at that moment . lift has always been a pioneer in the use of venues . they understand that theater and performance can happen anywhere . you can do a show in a schoolroom , in an airport , -- -- in a department store window . artists are explorers . who better to show us the city anew ? artists can take us to a far - flung part of the city that we have n't explored , or they can take us into that building that we pass every day but we never went into . an artist , i think , can really show us people that we might overlook in our lives . back to back is an australian company of people with intellectual disabilities . i saw their amazing show in new york at the staten island ferry terminal at rush hour . we , the audience , were given headsets and seated on one side of the terminal . the actors were right there in front of us , right there among the commuters , and we could hear them , but we might not have otherwise seen them . so back to back takes site - specific theater and uses it to gently remind us about who and what we choose to edit out of our daily lives . so , the dialogue with the local and the global , the audience as participant and player and protagonist , the innovative use of site , all of these things come to play in the amazing work of the fantastic french company royal de luxe . royal de luxe 's giant puppets come into a city and they live there for a few days . for " the sultan 's elephant , " royal de luxe came to central london and brought it to a standstill with their story of a giant little girl and her friend , a time - traveling elephant . for a few days , they transformed a massive city into a community where endless possibility reigned . the guardian wrote , " if art is about transformation , then there can be no more transformative experience . what ' the sultan 's elephant ' represents is no less than an artistic occupation of the city and a reclamation of the streets for the people . " we can talk about the economic impacts of these festivals on their cities , but i 'm much [ more ] interested in many more things , like how a festival helps a city to express itself , how it lets it come into its own . festivals promote diversity , they bring neighbors into dialogue , they increase creativity , they offer opportunities for civic pride , they improve our general psychological well - being . in short , they make cities better places to live . case in point : when " the sultan 's elephant " came to london just nine months after 7/7 , a londoner wrote , " for the first time since the london bombings , my daughter called up with that sparkle back in her voice . she had gathered with others to watch ' the sultan 's elephant , ' and , you know , it just made all the difference . " lyn gardner in the guardian has written that a great festival can show us a map of the world , a map of the city and a map of ourselves , but there is no one fixed festival model . i think what 's so brilliant about the festivals , the new festivals , is that they are really fully capturing the complexity and the excitement of the way we all live today . thank you very much .
technology	so just by a show of hands , how many of you all have a robot at home ? not very many of you . okay . and actually of those hands , if you do n't include roomba how many of you have a robot at home ? so a couple . that 's okay . that 's the problem that we 're trying to solve at romotive -- that i and the other 20 nerds at romotive are obsessed with solving . so we really want to build a robot that anyone can use , whether you 're eight or 80 . and as it turns out , that 's a really hard problem , because you have to build a small , portable robot that 's not only really affordable , but it has to be something that people actually want to take home and have around their kids . this robot ca n't be creepy or uncanny . he should be friendly and cute . so meet romo . romo 's a robot that uses a device you already know and love -- your iphone -- as his brain . and by leveraging the power of the iphone 's processor , we can create a robot that is wi - fi enabled and computer vision - capable for 150 bucks , which is about one percent of what these kinds of robots have cost in the past . when romo wakes up , he 's in creature mode . so he 's actually using the video camera on the device to follow my face . if i duck down , he 'll follow me . he 's wary , so he 'll keep his eyes on me . if i come over here , he 'll turn to follow me . if i come over here -- he 's smart . and if i get too close to him , he gets scared just like any other creature . so in a lot of ways , romo is like a pet that has a mind of his own . thanks , little guy . bless you . and if i want to explore the world -- uh - oh , romo 's tired -- if i want to explore the world with romo , i can actually connect him from any other ios device . so here 's the ipad . and romo will actually stream video to this device . so i can see everything that romo sees , and i get a robot 's - eye - view of the world . now this is a free app on the app store , so if any of you guys had this app on your phones , we could literally right now share control of the robot and play games together . so i 'll show you really quickly , romo actually -- he 's streaming video , so you can see me and the entire ted audience . if i get in front of romo here . and if i want to control him , i can just drive . so i can drive him around , and i can take pictures of you . i 've always wanted a picture of a 1,500 - person ted audience . so i 'll snap a picture . and in the same way that you scroll through content on an ipad , i can actually adjust the angle of the camera on the device . so there are all of you through romo 's eyes . and finally , because romo is an extension of me , i can express myself through his emotions . so i can go in and i can say let 's make romo excited . but the most important thing about romo is that we wanted to create something that was literally completely intuitive . you do not have to teach someone how to drive romo . in fact , who would like to drive a robot ? okay . awesome . here you go . thank you , scott . and even cooler , you actually do n't have to be in the same geographic location as the robot to control him . so he actually streams two - way audio and video between any two smart devices . so you can log in through the browser , and it 's kind of like skype on wheels . so we were talking before about telepresence , and this is a really cool example . you can imagine an eight - year - old girl , for example , who has an iphone , and her mom buys her a robot . that girl can take her iphone , put it on the robot , send an email to grandma , who lives on the other side of the country . grandma can log into that robot and play hide - and - go - seek with her granddaughter for fifteen minutes every single night , when otherwise she might only be able to get to see her granddaughter once or twice a year . thanks , scott . so those are a couple of the really cool things that romo can do today . but i just want to finish by talking about something that we 're working on in the future . this is actually something that one of our engineers , dom , built in a weekend . it 's built on top of a google open framework called blockly . this allows you to drag and drop these blocks of semantic code and create any behavior for this robot you want . you do not have to know how to code to create a behavior for romo . and you can actually simulate that behavior in the browser , which is what you see romo doing on the left . and then if you have something you like , you can download it onto your robot and execute it in real life , run the program in real life . and then if you have something you 're proud of , you can share it with every other person who owns a robot in the world . so all of these wi - fi -- enabled robots actually learn from each other . the reason we 're so focused on building robots that everyone can train is that we think the most compelling use cases in personal robotics are personal . they change from person to person . so we think that if you 're going to have a robot in your home , that robot ought to be a manifestation of your own imagination . so i wish that i could tell you what the future of personal robotics looks like . to be honest , i have no idea . but what we do know is that it is n't 10 years or 10 billion dollars or a large humanoid robot away . the future of personal robotics is happening today , and it 's going to depend on small , agile robots like romo and the creativity of people like yourselves . so we ca n't wait to get you all robots , and we ca n't wait to see what you build . thank you .
global health	i 'd like to share with you the story of one of my patients called celine . celine is a housewife and lives in a rural district of cameroon in west central africa . six years ago , at the time of her hiv diagnosis , she was recruited to participate in the clinical trial which was running in her health district at the time . when i first met celine , a little over a year ago , she had gone for 18 months without any antiretroviral therapy , and she was very ill. she told me that she stopped coming to the clinic when the trial ended because she had no money for the bus fare and was too ill to walk the 35 - kilometer distance . now during the clinical trial , she 'd been given all her antiretroviral drugs free of charge , and her transportation costs had been covered by the research funds . all of these ended once the trial was completed , leaving celine with no alternatives . she was unable to tell me the names of the drugs she 'd received during the trial , or even what the trial had been about . i did n't bother to ask her what the results of the trial were because it seemed obvious to me that she would have no clue . yet what puzzled me most was celine had given her informed consent to be a part of this trial , yet she clearly did not understand the implications of being a participant or what would happen to her once the trial had been completed . now , i have shared this story with you as an example of what can happen to participants in the clinical trial when it is poorly conducted . maybe this particular trial yielded exciting results . maybe it even got published in a high - profile scientific journal . maybe it would inform clinicians around the world on how to improve on the clinical management of hiv patients . but it would have done so at a price to hundreds of patients who , like celine , were left to their own devices once the research had been completed . i do not stand here today to suggest in any way that conducting hiv clinical trials in developing countries is bad . on the contrary , clinical trials are extremely useful tools , and are much needed to address the burden of disease in developing countries . however , the inequalities that exist between richer countries and developing countries in terms of funding pose a real risk for exploitation , especially in the context of externally - funded research . sadly enough , the fact remains that a lot of the studies that are conducted in developing countries could never be authorized in the richer countries which fund the research . i 'm sure you must be asking yourselves what makes developing countries , especially those in sub - saharan africa , so attractive for these hiv clinical trials ? well , in order for a clinical trial to generate valid and widely applicable results , they need to be conducted with large numbers of study participants and preferably on a population with a high incidence of new hiv infections . sub - saharan africa largely fits this description , with 22 million people living with hiv , an estimated 70 percent of the 30 million people who are infected worldwide . also , research within the continent is a lot easier to conduct due to widespread poverty , endemic diseases and inadequate health care systems . a clinical trial that is considered to be potentially beneficial to the population is more likely to be authorized , and in the absence of good health care systems , almost any offer of medical assistance is accepted as better than nothing . even more problematic reasons include lower risk of litigation , less rigorous ethical reviews , and populations that are willing to participate in almost any study that hints at a cure . as funding for hiv research increases in developing countries and ethical review in richer countries become more strict , you can see why this context becomes very , very attractive . the high prevalence of hiv drives researchers to conduct research that is sometimes scientifically acceptable but on many levels ethically questionable . how then can we ensure that , in our search for the cure , we do not take an unfair advantage of those who are already most affected by the pandemic ? i invite you to consider four areas i think we can focus on in order to improve the way in which things are done . the first of these is informed consent . now , in order for a clinical trial to be considered ethically acceptable , participants must be given the relevant information in a way in which they can understand , and must freely consent to participate in the trial . this is especially important in developing countries , where a lot of participants consent to research because they believe it is the only way in which they can receive medical care or other benefits . consent procedures that are used in richer countries are often inappropriate or ineffective in a lot of developing countries . for example , it is counterintuitive to have an illiterate study participant , like celine , sign a lengthy consent form that they are unable to read , local communities need to be more involved in establishing the criteria for recruiting participants in clinical trials , as well as the incentives for participation . the information in these trials needs to be given to the potential participants in linguistically and culturally acceptable formats . the second point i would like for you to consider is the standard of care that is provided to participants within any clinical trial . now , this is subject to a lot of debate and controversy . should the control group in the clinical trial be given the best current treatment which is available anywhere in the world ? or should they be given an alternative standard of care , such as the best current treatment available in the country in which the research is being conducted ? is it fair to evaluate a treatment regimen which may not be affordable or accessible to the study participants once the research has been completed ? now , in a situation where the best current treatment is inexpensive and simple to deliver , the answer is straightforward . however , the best current treatment available anywhere in the world is often very difficult to provide in developing countries . it is important to assess the potential risks and benefits of the standard of care which is to be provided to participants in any clinical trial , and establish one which is relevant for the context of the study and most beneficial for the participants within the study . that brings us to the third point i want you think about : the ethical review of research . an effective system for reviewing the ethical suitability of clinical trials is primordial to safeguard participants within any clinical trial . unfortunately , this is often lacking or inefficient in a lot of developing countries . local governments need to set up effective systems for reviewing the ethical issues around the clinical trials which are authorized in different developing countries , and they need to do this by setting up ethical review committees that are independent of the government and research sponsors . public accountability needs to be promoted through transparency and independent review by nongovernmental and international organizations as appropriate . the final point i would like for you to consider tonight is what happens to participants in the clinical trial once the research has been completed . i think it is absolutely wrong for research to begin in the first place without a clear plan for what would happen to the participants once the trial has ended . now , researchers need to make every effort to ensure that an intervention that has been shown to be beneficial during a clinical trial is accessible to the participants of the trial once the trial has been completed . in addition , they should be able to consider the possibility of introducing and maintaining effective treatments in the wider community once the trial ends . if , for any reason , they feel that this might not be possible , then i think they should have to ethically justify why the clinical trial should be conducted in the first place . now , fortunately for celine , our meeting did not end in my office . i was able to get her enrolled into a free hiv treatment program closer to her home , and with a support group to help her cope . her story has a positive ending , but there are thousands of others in similar situations who are much less fortunate . although she may not know this , my encounter with celine has completely changed the way in which i view hiv clinical trials in developing countries , and made me even more determined to be part of the movement to change the way in which things are done . i believe that every single person listening to me tonight can be part of that change . if you are a researcher , i hold you to a higher standard of moral conscience , to remain ethical in your research , and not compromise human welfare in your search for answers . if you work for a funding agency or pharmaceutical company , i challenge you to hold your employers to fund research that is ethically sound . if you come from a developing country like myself , i urge you to hold your government to a more thorough review of the clinical trials which are authorized in your country . yes , there is a need for us to find a cure for hiv , to find an effective vaccine for malaria , to find a diagnostic tool that works for t.b. , but i believe that we owe it to those who willingly and selflessly consent to participate in these clinical trials to do this in a humane way . thank you .
design technology art entertainment	well , i was born with a rare visual condition called achromatopsia , which is total color blindness , so i 've never seen color , and i do n't know what color looks like , because i come from a grayscale world . to me , the sky is always gray , flowers are always gray , and television is still in black and white . but , since the age of 21 , instead of seeing color , i can hear color . in 2003 , i started a project with computer scientist adam montandon , and the result , with further collaborations with peter kese from slovenia and matias lizana from barcelona , is this electronic eye . it 's a color sensor that detects the color frequency in front of me -- -- and sends this frequency to a chip installed at the back of my head , and i hear the color in front of me through the bone , through bone conduction . so , for example , if i have , like -- this is the sound of purple . for example , this is the sound of grass . this is red , like ted . this is the sound of a dirty sock . which is like yellow , this one . so i 've been hearing color all the time for eight years , since 2004 , so i find it completely normal now to hear color all the time . at the start , though , i had to memorize the names you give for each color , so i had to memorize the notes , but after some time , all this information became a perception . i did n't have to think about the notes . and after some time , this perception became a feeling . i started to have favorite colors , and i started to dream in colors . so , when i started to dream in color is when i felt that the software and my brain had united , because in my dreams , it was my brain creating electronic sounds . it was n't the software , so that 's when i started to feel like a cyborg . it 's when i started to feel that the cybernetic device was no longer a device . it had become a part of my body , an extension of my senses , and after some time , it even became a part of my official image . this is my passport from 2004 . you 're not allowed to appear on u.k. passports with electronic equipment , but i insisted to the passport office that what they were seeing was actually a new part of my body , an extension of my brain , and they finally accepted me to appear with the passport photo . so , life has changed dramatically since i hear color , because color is almost everywhere , so the biggest change for example is going to an art gallery , i can listen to a picasso , for example . so it 's like i 'm going to a concert hall , because i can listen to the paintings . and supermarkets , i find this is very shocking , it 's very , very attractive to walk along a supermarket . it 's like going to a nightclub . it 's full of different melodies . yeah . especially the aisle with cleaning products . it 's just fabulous . also , the way i dress has changed . before , i used to dress in a way that it looked good . now i dress in a way that it sounds good . so today i 'm dressed in c major , so it 's quite a happy chord . if i had to go to a funeral , though , i would dress in b minor , which would be turquoise , purple and orange . also , food , the way i look at food has changed , because now i can display the food on a plate , so i can eat my favorite song . so depending on how i display it , i can hear and i can compose music with food . so imagine a restaurant where we can have , like , lady gaga salads as starters . i mean , this would get teenagers to eat their vegetables , probably . and also , some rachmaninov piano concertos as main dishes , and some bjork or madonna desserts , that would be a very exciting restaurant where you can actually eat songs . also , the way i perceive beauty has changed , because when i look at someone , i hear their face , so someone might look very beautiful but sound terrible . and it might happen the opposite , the other way around . so i really enjoy creating , like , sound portraits of people . instead of drawing someone 's face , like drawing the shape , i point at them with the eye and i write down the different notes i hear , and then i create sound portraits . here 's some faces . yeah , nicole kidman sounds good . some people , i would never relate , but they sound similar . prince charles has some similarities with nicole kidman . they have similar sound of eyes . so you relate people that you would n't relate , and you can actually also create concerts by looking at the audience faces . so i connect the eye , and then i play the audience 's faces . the good thing about this is , if the concert does n't sound good , it 's their fault . it 's not my fault , because -- and so another thing that happens is that i started having this secondary effect that normal sounds started to become color . i heard a telephone tone , and it felt green because it sounded just like the color green . the bbc beeps , they sound turquoise , and listening to mozart became a yellow experience , so i started to paint music and paint people 's voices , because people 's voices have frequencies that i relate to color . and here 's some music translated into color . for example , mozart , " queen of the night , " looks like this . very yellow and very colorful , because there 's many different frequencies . and this is a completely different song . it 's justin bieber 's " baby . " it is very pink and very yellow . so , also voices , i can transform speeches into color , for example , these are two very well - known speeches . one of them is martin luther king 's " i have a dream , " and the other one is hitler . and i like to exhibit these paintings in the exhibition halls without labels , and then i ask people , " which one do you prefer ? " and most people change their preference when i tell them that the one on the left is hitler and the one on the right is martin luther king . so i got to a point when i was able to perceive 360 colors , just like human vision . i was able to differentiate all the degrees of the color wheel . but then , i just thought that this human vision was n't good enough . there 's many , many more colors around us that we cannot perceive , but that electronic eyes can perceive . so i decided to continue extending my color senses , and i added infrared and i added ultraviolet to the color - to - sound scale , so now i can hear colors that the human eye cannot perceive . for example , perceiving infrared is good because you can actually detect if there 's movement detectors in a room . i can hear if someone points at me with a remote control . and the good thing about perceiving ultraviolet is that you can hear if it 's a good day or a bad day to sunbathe , because ultraviolet is a dangerous color , a color that can actually kill us , so i think we should all have this wish to perceive things that we cannot perceive . that 's why , two years ago , i created the cyborg foundation , which is a foundation that tries to help people become a cyborg , tries to encourage people to extend their senses by using technology as part of the body . we should all think that knowledge comes from our senses , so if we extend our senses , we will consequently extend our knowledge . i think life will be much more exciting when we stop creating applications for mobile phones and we start creating applications for our own body . i think this will be a big , big change that we will see during this century . so i do encourage you all to think about which senses you 'd like to extend . i would encourage you to become a cyborg . you wo n't be alone . thank you .
entertainment	when i was 14 years old , i had low self - esteem . i felt i was not talented at anything . one day , i bought a yo - yo . when i tried my first trick , it looked like this . i could n't even do the simplest trick , but it was very natural for me , because i was not dextrous , and hated all sports . but after one week of practicing , my throws became more like this . a bit better . i thought , the yo - yo is something for me to be good at , for the first time in my life . i found my passion . i was spending all my time practicing . it took me hours and hours a day to build my skills up to the next level . and then , four years later , when i was 18 years old , i was standing onstage at the world yo - yo contest . and i won . i was so excited . " yes , i did it ! i became a hero . i may get many sponsors , a lot of money , tons of interviews , and be on tv ! " i thought . but after coming back to japan , totally nothing changed in my life . i realized society did n't value my passion . so i went back to my college and became a typical japanese worker as a systems engineer . i felt my passion , heart and soul , had left my body . i felt i was not alive anymore . so i started to consider what i should do , and i thought , i wanted to make my performance better , and to show onstage how spectacular the yo - yo could be to change the public 's image of the yo - yo . so i quit my company and started a career as a professional performer . i started to learn classic ballet , jazz dance , acrobatics and other things to make my performance better . as a result of these efforts , and the help of many others , it happened . i won the world yo - yo contest again in the artistic performance division . i passed an audition for cirque du soleil . today , i am standing on the ted stage with the yo - yo in front of you . what i learned from the yo - yo is , if i make enough effort with huge passion , there is no impossible . could you let me share my passion with you through my performance ?
technology	let me tell you , it has been a fantastic month for deception . and i 'm not even talking about the american presidential race . we have a high - profile journalist caught for plagiarism , a young superstar writer whose book involves so many made up quotes that they 've pulled it from the shelves ; a new york times exposé on fake book reviews . it 's been fantastic . now , of course , not all deception hits the news . much of the deception is everyday . in fact , a lot of research shows that we all lie once or twice a day , as dave suggested . so it 's about 6:30 now , suggests that most of us should have lied . let 's take a look at winnipeg . how many of you , in the last 24 hours -- think back -- have told a little fib , or a big one ? how many have told a little lie out there ? all right , good . these are all the liars . make sure you pay attention to them . no , that looked good , it was about two thirds of you . the other third did n't lie , or perhaps forgot , or you 're lying to me about your lying , which is very , very devious . this fits with a lot of the research , which suggests that lying is very pervasive . it 's this pervasiveness , combined with the centrality to what it means to be a human , the fact that we can tell the truth or make something up , that has fascinated people throughout history . here we have diogenes with his lantern . does anybody know what he was looking for ? a single honest man , and he died without finding one back in greece . and we have confucius in the east who was really concerned with sincerity , not only that you walked the walk or talked the talk , but that you believed in what you were doing . you believed in your principles . now my first professional encounter with deception is a little bit later than these guys , a couple thousand years . i was a customs officer for canada back in the mid - '90s . yeah . i was defending canada 's borders . you may think that 's a weapon right there . in fact , that 's a stamp . i used a stamp to defend canada 's borders . very canadian of me . i learned a lot about deception while doing my duty here in customs , one of which was that most of what i thought i knew about deception was wrong , and i 'll tell you about some of that tonight . but even since just 1995 , '96 , the way we communicate has been completely transformed . we email , we text , we skype , we facebook . it 's insane . almost every aspect of human communication 's been changed , and of course that 's had an impact on deception . let me tell you a little bit about a couple of new deceptions we 've been tracking and documenting . they 're called the butler , the sock puppet and the chinese water army . it sounds a little bit like a weird book , but actually they 're all new types of lies . let 's start with the butlers . here 's an example of one : " on my way . " anybody ever written , " on my way ? " then you 've also lied . we 're never on our way . we 're thinking about going on our way . here 's another one : " sorry i did n't respond to you earlier . my battery was dead . " your battery was n't dead . you were n't in a dead zone . you just did n't want to respond to that person that time . here 's the last one : you 're talking to somebody , and you say , " sorry , got work , gotta go . " but really , you 're just bored . you want to talk to somebody else . each of these is about a relationship , and this is a 24/7 connected world . once you get my cell phone number , you can literally be in touch with me 24 hours a day . and so these lies are being used by people to create a buffer , like the butler used to do , between us and the connections to everybody else . but they 're very special . they use ambiguity that comes from using technology . you do n't know where i am or what i 'm doing or who i 'm with . and they 're aimed at protecting the relationships . these are n't just people being jerks . these are people that are saying , look , i do n't want to talk to you now , or i did n't want to talk to you then , but i still care about you . our relationship is still important . now , the sock puppet , on the other hand , is a totally different animal . the sock puppet is n't about ambiguity , per se . it 's about identity . let me give you a very recent example , as in , like , last week . here 's r.j. ellory , best - seller author in britain . here 's one of his bestselling books . here 's a reviewer online , on amazon . my favorite , by nicodemus jones , is , " whatever else it might do , it will touch your soul . " and of course , you might suspect that nicodemus jones is r.j. ellory . he wrote very , very positive reviews about himself . surprise , surprise . now this sock puppet stuff is n't actually that new . walt whitman also did this back in the day , before there was internet technology . sock puppet becomes interesting when we get to scale , which is the domain of the chinese water army . chinese water army refers to thousands of people in china that are paid small amounts of money to produce content . it could be reviews . it could be propaganda . the government hires these people , companies hire them , all over the place . in north america , we call this astroturfing , and astroturfing is very common now . there 's a lot of concerns about it . we see this especially with product reviews , book reviews , everything from hotels to whether that toaster is a good toaster or not . now , looking at these three reviews , or these three types of deception , you might think , wow , the internet is really making us a deceptive species , especially when you think about the astroturfing , where we can see deception brought up to scale . but actually , what i 've been finding is very different from that . now , let 's put aside the online anonymous sex chatrooms , which i 'm sure none of you have been in . i can assure you there 's deception there . and let 's put aside the nigerian prince who 's emailed you about getting the 43 million out of the country . let 's forget about that guy , too . let 's focus on the conversations between our friends and our family and our coworkers and our loved ones . those are the conversations that really matter . what does technology do to deception with those folks ? here 's a couple of studies . one of the studies we do are called diary studies , in which we ask people to record all of their conversations and all of their lies for seven days , and what we can do then is calculate how many lies took place per conversation within a medium , and the finding that we get that surprises people the most is that email is the most honest of those three media . and it really throws people for a loop because we think , well , there 's no nonverbal cues , so why do n't you lie more ? the phone , in contrast , the most lies . again and again and again we see the phone is the device that people lie on the most , and perhaps because of the butler lie ambiguities i was telling you about . this tends to be very different from what people expect . what about résumés ? we did a study in which we had people apply for a job , and they could apply for a job either with a traditional paper résumé , or on linkedin , which is a social networking site like facebook , but for professionals -- involves the same information as a résumé . and what we found , to many people 's surprise , was that those linkedin résumés were more honest on the things that mattered to employers , like your responsibilities or your skills at your previous job . how about facebook itself ? you know , we always think that hey , there are these idealized versions , people are just showing the best things that happened in their lives . i 've thought that many times . my friends , no way they can be that cool and have good of a life . well , one study tested this by examining people 's personalities . they had four good friends of a person judge their personality . then they had strangers , many strangers , judge the person 's personality just from facebook , and what they found was those judgments of the personality were pretty much identical , highly correlated , meaning that facebook profiles really do reflect our actual personality . all right , well , what about online dating ? i mean , that 's a pretty deceptive space . i 'm sure you all have " friends " that have used online dating . and they would tell you about that guy that had no hair when he came , or the woman that did n't look at all like her photo . well , we were really interested in it , and so what we did is we brought people , online daters , into the lab , and then we measured them . we got their height up against the wall , we put them on a scale , got their weight -- ladies loved that -- and then we actually got their driver 's license to get their age . and what we found was very , very interesting . here 's an example of the men and the height . along the bottom is how tall they said they were in their profile . along the y - axis , the vertical axis , is how tall they actually were . that diagonal line is the truth line . if their dot 's on it , they were telling exactly the truth . now , as you see , most of the little dots are below the line . what it means is all the guys were lying about their height . in fact , they lied about their height about nine tenths of an inch , what we say in the lab as " strong rounding up . " you get to 5'8 " and one tenth , and boom ! 5'9 " . but what 's really important here is , look at all those dots . they are clustering pretty close to the truth . what we found was 80 percent of our participants did indeed lie on one of those dimensions , but they always lied by a little bit . one of the reasons is pretty simple . if you go to a date , a coffee date , and you 're completely different than what you said , game over . right ? so people lied frequently , but they lied subtly , not too much . they were constrained . well , what explains all these studies ? what explains the fact that despite our intuitions , mine included , a lot of online communication , technologically - mediated communication , is more honest than face to face ? that really is strange . how do we explain this ? well , to do that , one thing is we can look at the deception - detection literature . it 's a very old literature by now , it 's coming up on 50 years . it 's been reviewed many times . there 's been thousands of trials , hundreds of studies , and there 's some really compelling findings . the first is , we 're really bad at detecting deception , really bad . fifty - four percent accuracy on average when you have to tell if somebody that just said a statement is lying or not . that 's really bad . why is it so bad ? well it has to do with pinocchio 's nose . if i were to ask you guys , what do you rely on when you 're looking at somebody and you want to find out if they 're lying ? what cue do you pay attention to ? most of you would say that one of the cues you look at is the eyes . the eyes are the window to the soul . and you 're not alone . around the world , almost every culture , one of the top cues is eyes . but the research over the last 50 years says there 's actually no reliable cue to deception , which blew me away , and it 's one of the hard lessons that i learned when i was customs officer . the eyes do not tell us whether somebody 's lying or not . some situations , yes -- high stakes , maybe their pupils dilate , their pitch goes up , their body movements change a little bit , but not all the time , not for everybody , it 's not reliable . strange . the other thing is that just because you ca n't see me does n't mean i 'm going to lie . it 's common sense , but one important finding is that we lie for a reason . we lie to protect ourselves or for our own gain or for somebody else 's gain . so there are some pathological liars , but they make up a tiny portion of the population . we lie for a reason . just because people ca n't see us does n't mean we 're going to necessarily lie . but i think there 's actually something much more interesting and fundamental going on here . the next big thing for me , the next big idea , we can find by going way back in history to the origins of language . most linguists agree that we started speaking somewhere between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago . that 's a long time ago . a lot of humans have lived since then . we 've been talking , i guess , about fires and caves and saber - toothed tigers . i do n't know what they talked about , but they were doing a lot of talking , and like i said , there 's a lot of humans evolving speaking , about 100 billion people in fact . what 's important though is that writing only emerged about 5,000 years ago . so what that means is that all the people before there was any writing , every word that they ever said , every utterance disappeared . no trace . evanescent . gone . so we 've been evolving to talk in a way in which there is no record . in fact , even the next big change to writing was only 500 years ago now , with the printing press , which is very recent in our past , and literacy rates remained incredibly low right up until world war ii , so even the people of the last two millennia , most of the words they ever said -- poof ! -- disappeared . let 's turn to now , the networked age . how many of you have recorded something today ? anybody do any writing today ? did anybody write a word ? it looks like almost every single person here recorded something . in this room , right now , we 've probably recorded more than almost all of human pre - ancient history . that is crazy . we 're entering this amazing period of flux in human evolution where we 've evolved to speak in a way in which our words disappear , but we 're in an environment where we 're recording everything . in fact , i think in the very near future , it 's not just what we write that will be recorded , everything we do will be recorded . what does that mean ? what 's the next big idea from that ? well , as a social scientist , this is the most amazing thing i have ever even dreamed of . now , i can look at all those words that used to , for millennia , disappear . i can look at lies that before were said and then gone . you remember those astroturfing reviews that we were talking about before ? well , when they write a fake review , they have to post it somewhere , and it 's left behind for us . so one thing that we did , and i 'll give you an example of looking at the language , is we paid people to write some fake reviews . one of these reviews is fake . the person never was at the james hotel . the other review is real . the person stayed there . now , your task now is to decide which review is fake ? i 'll give you a moment to read through them . but i want everybody to raise their hand at some point . remember , i study deception . i can tell if you do n't raise your hand . all right , how many of you believe that a is the fake ? all right . very good . about half . and how many of you think that b is ? all right . slightly more for b. excellent . here 's the answer . b is a fake . well done second group . you dominated the first group . you 're actually a little bit unusual . every time we demonstrate this , it 's usually about a 50-50 split , which fits with the research , 54 percent . maybe people here in winnipeg are more suspicious and better at figuring it out . those cold , hard winters , i love it . all right , so why do i care about this ? well , what i can do now with my colleagues in computer science is we can create computer algorithms that can analyze the linguistic traces of deception . let me highlight a couple of things here in the fake review . the first is that liars tend to think about narrative . they make up a story : who ? and what happened ? and that 's what happened here . our fake reviewers talked about who they were with and what they were doing . they also used the first person singular , i , way more than the people that actually stayed there . they were inserting themselves into the hotel review , kind of trying to convince you they were there . in contrast , the people that wrote the reviews that were actually there , their bodies actually entered the physical space , they talked a lot more about spatial information . they said how big the bathroom was , or they said , you know , here 's how far shopping is from the hotel . now , you guys did pretty well . most people perform at chance at this task . our computer algorithm is very accurate , much more accurate than humans can be , and it 's not going to be accurate all the time . this is n't a deception - detection machine to tell if your girlfriend 's lying to you on text messaging . we believe that every lie now , every type of lie -- fake hotel reviews , fake shoe reviews , your girlfriend cheating on you with text messaging -- those are all different lies . they 're going to have different patterns of language . but because everything 's recorded now , we can look at all of those kinds of lies . now , as i said , as a social scientist , this is wonderful . it 's transformational . we 're going to be able to learn so much more about human thought and expression , about everything from love to attitudes , because everything is being recorded now , but what does it mean for the average citizen ? what does it mean for us in our lives ? well , let 's forget deception for a bit . one of the big ideas , i believe , is that we 're leaving these huge traces behind . my outbox for email is massive , and i never look at it . i write all the time , but i never look at my record , at my trace . and i think we 're going to see a lot more of that , where we can reflect on who we are by looking at what we wrote , what we said , what we did . now , if we bring it back to deception , there 's a couple of take - away things here . first , lying online can be very dangerous , right ? not only are you leaving a record for yourself on your machine , but you 're leaving a record on the person that you were lying to , and you 're also leaving them around for me to analyze with some computer algorithms . so by all means , go ahead and do that , that 's good . but when it comes to lying and what we want to do with our lives , i think we can go back to diogenes and confucius . and they were less concerned about whether to lie or not to lie , and more concerned about being true to the self , and i think this is really important . now , when you are about to say or do something , we can think , do i want this to be part of my legacy , part of my personal record ? because in the digital age we live in now , in the networked age , we are all leaving a record . thank you so much for your time , and good luck with your record .

design art	today , i 'm going to talk to you about sketching electronics . i 'm , among several other things , an electrical engineer , and that means that i spend a good amount of time designing and building new pieces of technology , and more specifically designing and building electronics . and what i 've found is that the process of designing and building electronics is problematic in all sorts of ways . so it 's a really slow process , it 's really expensive , and the outcome of that process , namely electronic circuit boards , are limited in all sorts of kind of interesting ways . so they 're really small , generally , they 're square and flat and hard , and frankly , most of them just are n't very attractive , and so my team and i have been thinking of ways to really change and mix up the process and the outcome of designing electronics . and so what if you could design and build electronics like this ? so what if you could do it extremely quickly , extremely inexpensively , and maybe more interestingly , really fluidly and expressively and even improvisationally ? would n't that be so cool , and that would n't that open up all sorts of new possibilities ? i 'm going to share with you two projects that are investigations along these lines , and we 'll start with this one . magnetic electronic pieces and ferrous paper . a conductive pen from the lewis lab at uiuc . sticker templates . speed x 4 . making a switch . music : dj shadow . adding some intelligence with a microcontroller . sketching an interface . pretty cool , huh ? we think so . so now that we developed these tools and found these materials that let us do these things , we started to realize that , essentially , anything that we can do with paper , anything that we can do with a piece of paper and a pen we can now do with electronics . so the next project that i want to show you is kind of a deeper exploration of that possibility . and i 'll kind of let it speak for itself . so the next step for us in this process is now to find a way to let all of you build things like this , and so the way that we 're approaching that is by teaching workshops to people where we explain how they can use these kinds of tools , and then also working to get the tools and the materials and techniques out into the real world in a variety of ways . and so sometime soon , you 'll be able to play and build and sketch with electronics in this fundamentally new way . so thank you very much .
design art	as an architect , i often ask myself , what is the origin of the forms that we design ? what kind of forms could we design if we would n't work with references anymore ? if we had no bias , if we had no preconceptions , what kind of forms could we design if we could free ourselves from our experience ? if we could free ourselves from our education ? what would these unseen forms look like ? would they surprise us ? would they intrigue us ? would they delight us ? if so , then how can we go about creating something that is truly new ? i propose we look to nature . nature has been called the greatest architect of forms . and i 'm not saying that we should copy nature , i 'm not saying we should mimic biology , instead i propose that we can borrow nature 's processes . we can abstract them and to create something that is new . nature 's main process of creation , morphogenesis , is the splitting of one cell into two cells . and these cells can either be identical , or they can be distinct from each other through asymmetric cell division . if we abstract this process , and simplify it as much as possible , then we could start with a single sheet of paper , one surface , and we could make a fold and divide the surface into two surfaces . we 're free to choose where we make the fold . and by doing so , we can differentiate the surfaces . through this very simple process , we can create an astounding variety of forms . now , we can take this form and use the same process to generate three - dimensional structures , but rather than folding things by hand , we 'll bring the structure into the computer , and code it as an algorithm . and in doing so , we can suddenly fold anything . we can fold a million times faster , we can fold in hundreds and hundreds of variations . and as we 're seeking to make something three - dimensional , we start not with a single surface , but with a volume . a simple volume , the cube . if we take its surfaces and fold them again and again and again and again , then after 16 iterations , 16 steps , we end up with 400,000 surfaces and a shape that looks , for instance , like this . and if we change where we make the folds , if we change the folding ratio , then this cube turns into this one . we can change the folding ratio again to produce this shape , or this shape . so we exert control over the form by specifying the position of where we 're making the fold , but essentially you 're looking at a folded cube . and we can play with this . we can apply different folding ratios to different parts of the form to create local conditions . we can begin to sculpt the form . and because we 're doing the folding on the computer , we are completely free of any physical constraints . so that means that surfaces can intersect themselves , they can become impossibly small . we can make folds that we otherwise could not make . surfaces can become porous . they can stretch . they can tear . and all of this expounds the scope of forms that we can produce . but in each case , i did n't design the form . i designed the process that generated the form . in general , if we make a small change to the folding ratio , which is what you 're seeing here , then the form changes correspondingly . but that 's only half of the story -- 99.9 percent of the folding ratios produce not this , but this , the geometric equivalent of noise . the forms that i showed before were made actually through very long trial and error . a far more effective way to create forms , i have found , is to use information that is already contained in forms . a very simple form such as this one actually contains a lot of information that may not be visible to the human eye . so , for instance , we can plot the length of the edges . white surfaces have long edges , black ones have short ones . we can plot the planarity of the surfaces , their curvature , how radial they are -- all information that may not be instantly visible to you , but that we can bring out , that we can articulate , and that we can use to control the folding . so now i 'm not specifying a single ratio anymore to fold it , but instead i 'm establishing a rule , i 'm establishing a link between a property of a surface and how that surface is folded . and because i 've designed the process and not the form , i can run the process again and again and again to produce a whole family of forms . these forms look elaborate , but the process is a very minimal one . there is a simple input , it 's always a cube that i start with , and it 's a very simple operation -- it 's making a fold , and doing this over and over again . so let 's bring this process to architecture . how ? and at what scale ? i chose to design a column . columns are architectural archetypes . they 've been used throughout history to express ideals about beauty , about technology . a challenge to me was how we could express this new algorithmic order in a column . i started using four cylinders . through a lot of experimentation , these cylinders eventually evolved into this . and these columns , they have information at very many scales . we can begin to zoom into them . the closer one gets , the more new features one discovers . some formations are almost at the threshold of human visibility . and unlike traditional architecture , it 's a single process that creates both the overall form and the microscopic surface detail . these forms are undrawable . an architect who 's drawing them with a pen and a paper would probably take months , or it would take even a year to draw all the sections , all of the elevations , you can only create something like this through an algorithm . the more interesting question , perhaps , is , are these forms imaginable ? usually , an architect can somehow envision the end state of what he is designing . in this case , the process is deterministic . there 's no randomness involved at all , but it 's not entirely predictable . there 's too many surfaces , there 's too much detail , one ca n't see the end state . so this leads to a new role for the architect . one needs a new method to explore all of the possibilities that are out there . for one thing , one can design many variants of a form , in parallel , and one can cultivate them . and to go back to the analogy with nature , one can begin to think in terms of populations , one can talk about permutations , about generations , about crossing and breeding to come up with a design . and the architect is really , he moves into the position of being an orchestrator of all of these processes . but enough of the theory . at one point i simply wanted to jump inside this image , so to say , i bought these red and blue 3d glasses , got up very close to the screen , but still that was n't the same as being able to walk around and touch things . so there was only one possibility -- to bring the column out of the computer . there 's been a lot of talk now about 3d printing . for me , or for my purpose at this moment , there 's still too much of an unfavorable tradeoff between scale , on the one hand , and resolution and speed , on the other . so instead , we decided to take the column , and we decided to build it as a layered model , made out of very many slices , thinly stacked over each other . what you 're looking at here is an x - ray of the column that you just saw , viewed from the top . unbeknownst to me at the time , because we had only seen the outside , the surfaces were continuing to fold themselves , to grow on the inside of the column , which was quite a surprising discovery . from this shape , we calculated a cutting line , and then we gave this cutting line to a laser cutter to produce -- and you 're seeing a segment of it here -- very many thin slices , individually cut , on top of each other . and this is a photo now , it 's not a rendering , and the column that we ended up with after a lot of work , ended up looking remarkably like the one that we had designed in the computer . almost all of the details , almost all of the surface intricacies were preserved . but it was very labor intensive . there 's a huge disconnect at the moment still between the virtual and the physical . it took me several months to design the column , but ultimately it takes the computer about 30 seconds to calculate all of the 16 million faces . the physical model , on the other hand , is 2,700 layers , one millimeter thick , it weighs 700 kilos , it 's made of sheet that can cover this entire auditorium . and the cutting path that the laser followed goes from here to the airport and back again . but it is increasingly possible . machines are getting faster , it 's getting less expensive , and there 's some promising technological developments just on the horizon . these are images from the gwangju biennale . and in this case , i used abs plastic to produce the columns , we used the bigger , faster machine , and they have a steel core inside , so they 're structural , they can bear loads for once . each column is effectively a hybrid of two columns . you can see a different column in the mirror , if there 's a mirror behind the column that creates a sort of an optical illusion . so where does this leave us ? i think this project gives us a glimpse of the unseen objects that await us if we as architects begin to think about designing not the object , but a process to generate objects . i 've shown one simple process that was inspired by nature ; there 's countless other ones . in short , we have no constraints . instead , we have processes in our hands right now that allow us to create structures at all scales that we could n't even have dreamt up . and , if i may add , at one point we will build them . thank you .
technology business	as it turns out , when tens of millions of people are unemployed or underemployed , there 's a fair amount of interest in what technology might be doing to the labor force . and as i look at the conversation , it strikes me that it 's focused on exactly the right topic , and at the same time , it 's missing the point entirely . the topic that it 's focused on , the question is whether or not all these digital technologies are affecting people 's ability to earn a living , or , to say it a little bit different way , are the droids taking our jobs ? and there 's some evidence that they are . the great recession ended when american gdp resumed its kind of slow , steady march upward , and some other economic indicators also started to rebound , and they got kind of healthy kind of quickly . corporate profits are quite high . in fact , if you include bank profits , they 're higher than they 've ever been . and business investment in gear , in equipment and hardware and software is at an all - time high . so the businesses are getting out their checkbooks . what they 're not really doing is hiring . so this red line is the employment - to - population ratio , in other words , the percentage of working age people in america who have work . and we see that it cratered during the great recession , and it has n't started to bounce back at all . but the story is not just a recession story . the decade that we 've just been through had relatively anemic job growth all throughout , especially when we compare it to other decades , and the 2000s are the only time we have on record where there were fewer people working at the end of the decade than at the beginning . this is not what you want to see . when you graph the number of potential employees versus the number of jobs in the country , you see the gap gets bigger and bigger over time , and then , during the great recession , it opened up in a huge way . i did some quick calculations . i took the last 20 years of gdp growth and the last 20 years of labor productivity growth and used those in a fairly straightforward way to try to project how many jobs the economy was going to need to keep growing , and this is the line that i came up with . is that good or bad ? this is the government 's projection for the working age population going forward . so if these predictions are accurate , that gap is not going to close . the problem is , i do n't think these projections are accurate . in particular , i think my projection is way too optimistic , because when i did it , i was assuming that the future was kind of going to look like the past with labor productivity growth , and that 's actually not what i believe , because when i look around , i think that we ai n't seen nothing yet when it comes to technology 's impact on the labor force . just in the past couple years , we 've seen digital tools display skills and abilities that they never , ever had before , and that , kind of , eat deeply into what we human beings do for a living . let me give you a couple examples . throughout all of history , if you wanted something translated from one language into another , you had to involve a human being . now we have multi - language , instantaneous , automatic translation services available for free via many of our devices all the way down to smartphones . and if any of us have used these , we know that they 're not perfect , but they 're decent . throughout all of history , if you wanted something written , a report or an article , you had to involve a person . not anymore . this is an article that appeared in forbes online a while back about apple 's earnings . it was written by an algorithm . and it 's not decent , it 's perfect . a lot of people look at this and they say , " okay , but those are very specific , narrow tasks , and most knowledge workers are actually generalists , and what they do is sit on top of a very large body of expertise and knowledge and they use that to react on the fly to kind of unpredictable demands , and that 's very , very hard to automate . " one of the most impressive knowledge workers in recent memory is a guy named ken jennings . he won the quiz show " jeopardy ! " 74 times in a row , took home three million dollars . that 's ken on the right getting beat three to one by watson , the " jeopardy ! " - playing supercomputer from ibm . so when we look at what technology can do to general knowledge workers , i start to think there might not be something so special about this idea of a generalist , particularly when we start doing things like hooking siri up to watson and having technologies that can understand what we 're saying and repeat speech back to us . now , siri is far from perfect , and we can make fun of her flaws , but we should also keep in mind that if technologies like siri and watson improve along a moore 's law trajectory , which they will , in six years , they 're not going to be two times better or four times better , they 'll be 16 times better than they are right now . so i start to think that a lot of knowledge work is going to be affected by this . and digital technologies are not just impacting knowledge work . they 're starting to flex their muscles in the physical world as well . i had the chance a little while back to ride in the google autonomous car , which is as cool as it sounds . and i will vouch that it handled the stop - and - go traffic on u.s. 101 very smoothly . there are about three and a half million people who drive trucks for a living in the united states . i think some of them are going to be affected by this technology . and right now , humanoid robots are still incredibly primitive . they ca n't do very much . but they 're getting better quite quickly , and darpa , which is the investment arm of the defense department , is trying to accelerate their trajectory . so , in short , yeah , the droids are coming for our jobs . in the short term , we can stimulate job growth by encouraging entrepreneurship and by investing in infrastructure , because the robots today still are n't very good at fixing bridges . but in the not - too - long - term , i think within the lifetimes of most of the people in this room , we 're going to transition into an economy that is very productive but that just does n't need a lot of human workers , and managing that transition is going to be the greatest challenge that our society faces . voltaire summarized why . he said , " work saves us from three great evils : boredom , vice and need . " but despite this challenge , i 'm personally , i 'm still a huge digital optimist , and i am supremely confident that the digital technologies that we 're developing now are going to take us into a utopian future , not a dystopian future . and to explain why , i want to pose kind of a ridiculously broad question . i want to ask what have been the most important developments in human history ? now , i want to share some of the answers that i 've gotten in response to this question . it 's a wonderful question to ask and to start an endless debate about , because some people are going to bring up systems of philosophy in both the west and the east that have changed how a lot of people think about the world . and then other people will say , " no , actually , the big stories , the big developments are the founding of the world 's major religions , which have changed civilizations and have changed and influenced how countless people are living their lives . " and then some other folk will say , " actually , what changes civilizations , what modifies them and what changes people 's lives are empires , so the great developments in human history are stories of conquest and of war . " and then some cheery soul usually always pipes up and says , " hey , do n't forget about plagues . " there are some optimistic answers to this question , so some people will bring up the age of exploration and the opening up of the world . others will talk about intellectual achievements in disciplines like math that have helped us get a better handle on the world , and other folk will talk about periods when there was a deep flourishing of the arts and sciences . so this debate will go on and on . it 's an endless debate , and there 's no conclusive , no single answer to it . but if you 're a geek like me , you say , " well , what do the data say ? " and you start to do things like graph things that we might be interested in , the total worldwide population , for example , or some measure of social development , or the state of advancement of a society , and you start to plot the data , because , by this approach , the big stories , the big developments in human history , are the ones that will bend these curves a lot . so when you do this , and when you plot the data , you pretty quickly come to some weird conclusions . you conclude , actually , that none of these things have mattered very much . they have n't done a darn thing to the curves . there has been one story , one development in human history that bent the curve , bent it just about 90 degrees , and it is a technology story . the steam engine , and the other associated technologies of the industrial revolution changed the world and influenced human history so much , that in the words of the historian ian morris , they made mockery out of all that had come before . and they did this by infinitely multiplying the power of our muscles , overcoming the limitations of our muscles . now , what we 're in the middle of now is overcoming the limitations of our individual brains and infinitely multiplying our mental power . how can this not be as big a deal as overcoming the limitations of our muscles ? so at the risk of repeating myself a little bit , when i look at what 's going on with digital technology these days , we are not anywhere near through with this journey , and when i look at what is happening to our economies and our societies , my single conclusion is that we ai n't seen nothing yet . the best days are really ahead . let me give you a couple examples . economies do n't run on energy . they do n't run on capital , they do n't run on labor . economies run on ideas . so the work of innovation , the work of coming up with new ideas , is some of the most powerful , some of the most fundamental work that we can do in an economy . and this is kind of how we used to do innovation . we 'd find a bunch of fairly similar - looking people -- -- we 'd take them out of elite institutions , we 'd put them into other elite institutions , and we 'd wait for the innovation . now -- -- as a white guy who spent his whole career at mit and harvard , i got no problem with this . but some other people do , and they 've kind of crashed the party and loosened up the dress code of innovation . so here are the winners of a top coder programming challenge , and i assure you that nobody cares where these kids grew up , where they went to school , or what they look like . all anyone cares about is the quality of the work , the quality of the ideas . and over and over again , we see this happening in the technology - facilitated world . the work of innovation is becoming more open , more inclusive , more transparent , and more merit - based , and that 's going to continue no matter what mit and harvard think of it , and i could n't be happier about that development . i hear once in a while , " okay , i 'll grant you that , but technology is still a tool for the rich world , and what 's not happening , these digital tools are not improving the lives of people at the bottom of the pyramid . " and i want to say to that very clearly : nonsense . the bottom of the pyramid is benefiting hugely from technology . the economist robert jensen did this wonderful study a while back where he watched , in great detail , what happened to the fishing villages of kerala , india , when they got mobile phones for the very first time , and when you write for the quarterly journal of economics , you have to use very dry and very circumspect language , but when i read his paper , i kind of feel jensen is trying to scream at us , and say , look , this was a big deal . prices stabilized , so people could plan their economic lives . waste was not reduced ; it was eliminated . and the lives of both the buyers and the sellers in these villages measurably improved . now , what i do n't think is that jensen got extremely lucky and happened to land in the one set of villages where technology made things better . what happened instead is he very carefully documented what happens over and over again when technology comes for the first time to an environment and a community . the lives of people , the welfares of people , improve dramatically . so as i look around at all the evidence , and i think about the room that we have ahead of us , i become a huge digital optimist , and i start to think that this wonderful statement from the physicist freeman dyson is actually not hyperbole . this is an accurate assessment of what 's going on . our digital -- our technologies are great gifts , and we , right now , have the great good fortune to be living at a time when digital technology is flourishing , when it is broadening and deepening and becoming more profound all around the world . so , yeah , the droids are taking our jobs , but focusing on that fact misses the point entirely . the point is that then we are freed up to do other things , and what we are going to do , i am very confident , what we 're going to do is reduce poverty and drudgery and misery around the world . i 'm very confident we 're going to learn to live more lightly on the planet , and i am extremely confident that what we 're going to do with our new digital tools is going to be so profound and so beneficial that it 's going to make a mockery out of everything that came before . i 'm going to leave the last word to a guy who had a front row seat for digital progress , our old friend ken jennings . i 'm with him . i 'm going to echo his words : " i , for one , welcome our new computer overlords . " thanks very much .
science health	organic chemists make molecules , very complicated molecules , by chopping up a big molecule into small molecules and reverse engineering . and as a chemist , one of the things i wanted to ask my research group a couple of years ago is , could we make a really cool universal chemistry set ? in essence , could we " app " chemistry ? now what would this mean , and how would we do it ? well to start to do this , we took a 3d printer and we started to print our beakers and our test tubes on one side and then print the molecule at the same time on the other side and combine them together in what we call reactionware . and so by printing the vessel and doing the chemistry at the same time , we may start to access this universal toolkit of chemistry . now what could this mean ? well if we can embed biological and chemical networks like a search engine , so if you have a cell that 's ill that you need to cure or bacteria that you want to kill , if you have this embedded in your device at the same time , and you do the chemistry , you may be able to make drugs in a new way . so how are we doing this in the lab ? well it requires software , it requires hardware and it requires chemical inks . and so the really cool bit is , the idea is that we want to have a universal set of inks that we put out with the printer , and you download the blueprint , the organic chemistry for that molecule and you make it in the device . and so you can make your molecule in the printer using this software . so what could this mean ? well , ultimately , it could mean that you could print your own medicine . and this is what we 're doing in the lab at the moment . but to take baby steps to get there , first of all we want to look at drug design and production , or drug discovery and manufacturing . because if we can manufacture it after we 've discovered it , we could deploy it anywhere . you do n't need to go to the chemist anymore . we can print drugs at point of need . we can download new diagnostics . say a new super bug has emerged . you put it in your search engine , and you create the drug to treat the threat . so this allows you on - the - fly molecular assembly . but perhaps for me the core bit going into the future is this idea of taking your own stem cells , with your genes and your environment , and you print your own personal medicine . and if that does n't seem fanciful enough , where do you think we 're going to go ? well , you 're going to have your own personal matter fabricator . beam me up , scotty .
education technology	what is going to be the future of learning ? i do have a plan , but in order for me to tell you what that plan is , i need to tell you a little story , which kind of sets the stage . i tried to look at where did the kind of learning we do in schools , where did it come from ? and you can look far back into the past , but if you look at present - day schooling the way it is , it 's quite easy to figure out where it came from . it came from about 300 years ago , and it came from the last and the biggest of the empires on this planet . [ " the british empire " ] imagine trying to run the show , trying to run the entire planet , without computers , without telephones , with data handwritten on pieces of paper , and traveling by ships . but the victorians actually did it . what they did was amazing . they created a global computer made up of people . it 's still with us today . it 's called the bureaucratic administrative machine . in order to have that machine running , you need lots and lots of people . they made another machine to produce those people : the school . the schools would produce the people who would then become parts of the bureaucratic administrative machine . they must be identical to each other . they must know three things : they must have good handwriting , because the data is handwritten ; they must be able to read ; and they must be able to do multiplication , division , addition and subtraction in their head . they must be so identical that you could pick one up from new zealand and ship them to canada and he would be instantly functional . the victorians were great engineers . they engineered a system that was so robust that it 's still with us today , continuously producing identical people for a machine that no longer exists . the empire is gone , so what are we doing with that design that produces these identical people , and what are we going to do next if we ever are going to do anything else with it ? [ " schools as we know them are obsolete " ] so that 's a pretty strong comment there . i said schools as we know them now , they 're obsolete . i 'm not saying they 're broken . it 's quite fashionable to say that the education system 's broken . it 's not broken . it 's wonderfully constructed . it 's just that we do n't need it anymore . it 's outdated . what are the kind of jobs that we have today ? well , the clerks are the computers . they 're there in thousands in every office . and you have people who guide those computers to do their clerical jobs . those people do n't need to be able to write beautifully by hand . they do n't need to be able to multiply numbers in their heads . they do need to be able to read . in fact , they need to be able to read discerningly . well , that 's today , but we do n't even know what the jobs of the future are going to look like . we know that people will work from wherever they want , whenever they want , in whatever way they want . how is present - day schooling going to prepare them for that world ? well , i bumped into this whole thing completely by accident . i used to teach people how to write computer programs in new delhi , 14 years ago . and right next to where i used to work , there was a slum . and i used to think , how on earth are those kids ever going to learn to write computer programs ? or should they not ? at the same time , we also had lots of parents , rich people , who had computers , and who used to tell me , " you know , my son , i think he 's gifted , because he does wonderful things with computers . and my daughter -- oh , surely she is extra - intelligent . " and so on . so i suddenly figured that , how come all the rich people are having these extraordinarily gifted children ? what did the poor do wrong ? i made a hole in the boundary wall of the slum next to my office , and stuck a computer inside it just to see what would happen if i gave a computer to children who never would have one , did n't know any english , did n't know what the internet was . the children came running in . it was three feet off the ground , and they said , " what is this ? " and i said , " yeah , it 's , i do n't know . " they said , " why have you put it there ? " i said , " just like that . " and they said , " can we touch it ? " i said , " if you wish to . " and i went away . about eight hours later , we found them browsing and teaching each other how to browse . so i said , " well that 's impossible , because -- how is it possible ? they do n't know anything . " my colleagues said , " no , it 's a simple solution . one of your students must have been passing by , showed them how to use the mouse . " so i said , " yeah , that 's possible . " so i repeated the experiment . i went 300 miles out of delhi into a really remote village where the chances of a passing software development engineer was very little . i repeated the experiment there . there was no place to stay , so i stuck my computer in , i went away , came back after a couple of months , found kids playing games on it . when they saw me , they said , " we want a faster processor and a better mouse . " so i said , " how on earth do you know all this ? " and they said something very interesting to me . in an irritated voice , they said , " you 've given us a machine that works only in english , so we had to teach ourselves english in order to use it . " that 's the first time , as a teacher , that i had heard the word " teach ourselves " said so casually . here 's a short glimpse from those years . that 's the first day at the hole in the wall . on your right is an eight - year - old . to his left is his student . she 's six . and he 's teaching her how to browse . then onto other parts of the country , i repeated this over and over again , getting exactly the same results that we were . [ " hole in the wall film - 1999 " ] an eight - year - old telling his elder sister what to do . and finally a girl explaining in marathi what it is , and said , " there 's a processor inside . " so i started publishing . i published everywhere . i wrote down and measured everything , and i said , in nine months , a group of children left alone with a computer in any language will reach the same standard as an office secretary in the west . i 'd seen it happen over and over and over again . but i was curious to know , what else would they do if they could do this much ? i started experimenting with other subjects , among them , for example , pronunciation . there 's one community of children in southern india whose english pronunciation is really bad , and they needed good pronunciation because that would improve their jobs . i gave them a speech - to - text engine in a computer , and i said , " keep talking into it until it types what you say . " they did that , and watch a little bit of this . computer : nice to meet you . child : nice to meet you . sugata mitra : the reason i ended with the face of this young lady over there is because i suspect many of you know her . she has now joined a call center in hyderabad and may have tortured you about your credit card bills in a very clear english accent . so then people said , well , how far will it go ? where does it stop ? i decided i would destroy my own argument by creating an absurd proposition . i made a hypothesis , a ridiculous hypothesis . tamil is a south indian language , and i said , can tamil - speaking children in a south indian village learn the biotechnology of dna replication in english from a streetside computer ? and i said , i 'll measure them . they 'll get a zero . i 'll spend a couple of months , i 'll leave it for a couple of months , i 'll go back , they 'll get another zero . i 'll go back to the lab and say , we need teachers . i found a village . it was called kallikuppam in southern india . i put in hole in the wall computers there , downloaded all kinds of stuff from the internet about dna replication , most of which i did n't understand . the children came rushing , said , " what 's all this ? " so i said , " it 's very topical , very important . but it 's all in english . " so they said , " how can we understand such big english words and diagrams and chemistry ? " so by now , i had developed a new pedagogical method , so i applied that . i said , " i have n't the foggiest idea . " " and anyway , i am going away . " so i left them for a couple of months . they 'd got a zero . i gave them a test . i came back after two months and the children trooped in and said , " we 've understood nothing . " so i said , " well , what did i expect ? " so i said , " okay , but how long did it take you before you decided that you ca n't understand anything ? " so they said , " we have n't given up . we look at it every single day . " so i said , " what ? you do n't understand these screens and you keep staring at it for two months ? what for ? " so a little girl who you see just now , she raised her hand , and she says to me in broken tamil and english , she said , " well , apart from the fact that improper replication of the dna molecule causes disease , we have n't understood anything else . " so i tested them . i got an educational impossibility , zero to 30 percent in two months in the tropical heat with a computer under the tree in a language they did n't know doing something that 's a decade ahead of their time . absurd . but i had to follow the victorian norm . thirty percent is a fail . how do i get them to pass ? i have to get them 20 more marks . i could n't find a teacher . what i did find was a friend that they had , a 22 - year - old girl who was an accountant and she played with them all the time . so i asked this girl , " can you help them ? " so she says , " absolutely not . i did n't have science in school . i have no idea what they 're doing under that tree all day long . i ca n't help you . " i said , " i 'll tell you what . use the method of the grandmother . " so she says , " what 's that ? " i said , " stand behind them . whenever they do anything , you just say , ' well , wow , i mean , how did you do that ? what 's the next page ? gosh , when i was your age , i could have never done that . ' you know what grannies do . " so she did that for two more months . the scores jumped to 50 percent . kallikuppam had caught up with my control school in new delhi , a rich private school with a trained biotechnology teacher . when i saw that graph i knew there is a way to level the playing field . here 's kallikuppam . neurons ... communication . i got the camera angle wrong . that one is just amateur stuff , but what she was saying , as you could make out , was about neurons , with her hands were like that , and she was saying neurons communicate . at 12 . so what are jobs going to be like ? well , we know what they 're like today . what 's learning going to be like ? we know what it 's like today , children pouring over with their mobile phones on the one hand and then reluctantly going to school to pick up their books with their other hand . what will it be tomorrow ? could it be that we do n't need to go to school at all ? could it be that , at the point in time when you need to know something , you can find out in two minutes ? could it be -- a devastating question , a question that was framed for me by nicholas negroponte -- could it be that we are heading towards or maybe in a future where knowing is obsolete ? but that 's terrible . we are homo sapiens . knowing , that 's what distinguishes us from the apes . but look at it this way . it took nature 100 million years to make the ape stand up and become homo sapiens . it took us only 10,000 to make knowing obsolete . what an achievement that is . but we have to integrate that into our own future . encouragement seems to be the key . if you look at kuppam , if you look at all of the experiments that i did , it was simply saying , " wow , " saluting learning . there is evidence from neuroscience . the reptilian part of our brain , which sits in the center of our brain , when it 's threatened , it shuts down everything else , it shuts down the prefrontal cortex , the parts which learn , it shuts all of that down . punishment and examinations are seen as threats . we take our children , we make them shut their brains down , and then we say , " perform . " why did they create a system like that ? because it was needed . there was an age in the age of empires when you needed those people who can survive under threat . when you 're standing in a trench all alone , if you could have survived , you 're okay , you 've passed . if you did n't , you failed . but the age of empires is gone . what happens to creativity in our age ? we need to shift that balance back from threat to pleasure . i came back to england looking for british grandmothers . i put out notices and papers saying , if you are a british grandmother , if you have broadband and a web camera , can you give me one hour of your time per week for free ? i got 200 in the first two weeks . i know more british grandmothers than anyone in the universe . they 're called the granny cloud . the granny cloud sits on the internet . if there 's a child in trouble , we beam a gran . she goes on over skype and she sorts things out . i 've seen them do it from a village called diggles in northwestern england , deep inside a village in tamil nadu , india , 6,000 miles away . she does it with only one age - old gesture . " shhh . " okay ? watch this . grandmother : you ca n't catch me . you say it . you ca n't catch me . children : you ca n't catch me . grandmother : i 'm the gingerbread man . children : i 'm the gingerbread man . grandmother : well done ! very good . sm : so what 's happening here ? i think what we need to look at is we need to look at learning as the product of educational self - organization . if you allow the educational process to self - organize , then learning emerges . it 's not about making learning happen . it 's about letting it happen . the teacher sets the process in motion and then she stands back in awe and watches as learning happens . i think that 's what all this is pointing at . but how will we know ? how will we come to know ? well , i intend to build these self - organized learning environments . they are basically broadband , collaboration and encouragement put together . i 've tried this in many , many schools . it 's been tried all over the world , and teachers sort of stand back and say , " it just happens by itself ? " and i said , " yeah , it happens by itself . " " how did you know that ? " i said , " you wo n't believe the children who told me and where they 're from . " here 's a sole in action . this one is in england . he maintains law and order , because remember , there 's no teacher around . girl : the total of electrons is not equal to the total number of protons -- sm : australia girl : -- giving it a net positive of negative electrical charge . the net charge on an ion is equal to the number of protons in the ion minus the number of electrons . sm : a decade ahead of her time . so soles , i think we need a curriculum of big questions . you already heard about that . you know what that means . there was a time when stone age men and women used to sit and look up at the sky and say , " what are those twinkling lights ? " they built the first curriculum , but we 've lost sight of those wondrous questions . we 've brought it down to the tangent of an angle . but that 's not sexy enough . the way you would put it to a nine - year - old is to say , " if a meteorite was coming to hit the earth , how would you figure out if it was going to or not ? " and if he says , " well , what ? how ? " you say , " there 's a magic word . it 's called the tangent of an angle , " and leave him alone . he 'll figure it out . so here are a couple of images from soles . i 've tried incredible , incredible questions -- " when did the world begin ? how will it end ? " -- to nine - year - olds . this one is about what happens to the air we breathe . this is done by children without the help of any teacher . the teacher only raises the question , and then stands back and admires the answer . so what 's my wish ? my wish is that we design the future of learning . we do n't want to be spare parts for a great human computer , do we ? so we need to design a future for learning . and i 've got to -- hang on , i 've got to get this wording exactly right , because , you know , it 's very important . my wish is to help design a future of learning by supporting children all over the world to tap into their wonder and their ability to work together . help me build this school . it will be called the school in the cloud . it will be a school where children go on these intellectual adventures driven by the big questions which their mediators put in . the way i want to do this is to build a facility where i can study this . it 's a facility which is practically unmanned . there 's only one granny who manages health and safety . the rest of it 's from the cloud . the lights are turned on and off by the cloud , etc. , etc. , everything 's done from the cloud . but i want you for another purpose . you can do self - organized learning environments at home , in the school , outside of school , in clubs . it 's very easy to do . there 's a great document produced by ted which tells you how to do it . if you would please , please do it across all five continents and send me the data , then i 'll put it all together , move it into the school of clouds , and create the future of learning . that 's my wish . and just one last thing . i 'll take you to the top of the himalayas . at 12,000 feet , where the air is thin , i once built two hole in the wall computers , and the children flocked there . and there was this little girl who was following me around . and i said to her , " you know , i want to give a computer to everybody , every child . i do n't know , what should i do ? " and i was trying to take a picture of her quietly . she suddenly raised her hand like this , and said to me , " get on with it . " i think it was good advice . i 'll follow her advice . i 'll stop talking . thank you . thank you very much . thank you . thank you . thank you very much . wow .
technology	chris anderson : elon , what kind of crazy dream would persuade you to think of trying to take on the auto industry and build an all - electric car ? elon musk : well , it goes back to when i was in university . i thought about , what are the problems that are most likely to affect the future of the world or the future of humanity ? i think it 's extremely important that we have sustainable transport and sustainable energy production . that sort of overall sustainable energy problem is the biggest problem that we have to solve this century , independent of environmental concerns . in fact , even if producing co 2 was good for the environment , given that we 're going to run out of hydrocarbons , we need to find some sustainable means of operating . ca : most of american electricity comes from burning fossil fuels . how can an electric car that plugs into that electricity help ? em : right . there 's two elements to that answer . one is that , even if you take the same source fuel and produce power at the power plant and use it to charge electric cars , you 're still better off . so if you take , say , natural gas , which is the most prevalent hydrocarbon source fuel , if you burn that in a modern general electric natural gas turbine , you 'll get about 60 percent efficiency . if you put that same fuel in an internal combustion engine car , you get about 20 percent efficiency . and the reason is , in the stationary power plant , you can afford to have something that weighs a lot more , is voluminous , and you can take the waste heat and run a steam turbine and generate a secondary power source . so in effect , even after you 've taken transmission loss into account and everything , even using the same source fuel , you 're at least twice as better off charging an electric car , then burning it at the power plant . ca : that scale delivers efficiency . em : yes , it does . and then the other point is , we have to have sustainable means of power generation anyway , electricity generation . so given that we have to solve sustainable electricity generation , then it makes sense for us to have electric cars as the mode of transport . ca : so we 've got some video here of the tesla being assembled , which , if we could play that first video -- so what is innovative about this process in this vehicle ? em : sure . so , in order to accelerate the advent of electric transport , and i should say that i think , actually , all modes of transport will become fully electric with the ironic exception of rockets . there 's just no way around newton 's third law . the question is how do you accelerate the advent of electric transport ? and in order to do that for cars , you have to come up with a really energy efficient car , so that means making it incredibly light , and so what you 're seeing here is the only all - aluminum body and chassis car made in north america . in fact , we applied a lot of rocket design techniques to make the car light despite having a very large battery pack . and then it also has the lowest drag coefficient of any car of its size . so as a result , the energy usage is very low , and it has the most advanced battery pack , and that 's what gives it the range that 's competitive , so you can actually have on the order of a 250 - mile range . ca : i mean , those battery packs are incredibly heavy , but you think the math can still work out intelligently -- by combining light body , heavy battery , you can still gain spectacular efficiency . em : exactly . the rest of the car has to be very light to offset the mass of the pack , and then you have to have a low drag coefficient so that you have good highway range . and in fact , customers of the model s are sort of competing with each other to try to get the highest possible range . i think somebody recently got 420 miles out of a single charge . ca : bruno bowden , who 's here , did that , broke the world record . em : congratulations . ca : that was the good news . the bad news was that to do it , he had to drive at 18 miles an hour constant speed and got pulled over by the cops . em : i mean , you can certainly drive -- if you drive it 65 miles an hour , under normal conditions , 250 miles is a reasonable number . ca : let 's show that second video showing the tesla in action on ice . not at all a dig at the new york times , this , by the way . what is the most surprising thing about the experience of driving the car ? em : in creating an electric car , the responsiveness of the car is really incredible . so we wanted really to have people feel as though they 've almost got to mind meld with the car , so you just feel like you and the car are kind of one , and as you corner and accelerate , it just happens , like the car has esp . you can do that with an electric car because of its responsiveness . you ca n't do that with a gasoline car . i think that 's really a profound difference , and people only experience that when they have a test drive . ca : i mean , this is a beautiful but expensive car . is there a road map where this becomes a mass - market vehicle ? em : yeah . the goal of tesla has always been to have a sort of three - step process , where version one was an expensive car at low volume , version two is medium priced and medium volume , and then version three would be low price , high volume . so we 're at step two at this point . so we had a $ 100,000 sports car , which was the roadster . then we 've got the model s , which starts at around 50,000 dollars . and our third generation car , which should hopefully be out in about three or four years will be a $ 30,000 car . but whenever you 've got really new technology , it generally takes about three major versions in order to make it a compelling mass - market product . and so i think we 're making progress in that direction , and i feel confident that we 'll get there . ca : i mean , right now , if you 've got a short commute , you can drive , you can get back , you can charge it at home . there is n't a huge nationwide network of charging stations now that are fast . do you see that coming , really , truly , or just on a few key routes ? em : there actually are far more charging stations than people realize , and at tesla we developed something called a supercharging technology , and we 're offering that if you buy a model s for free , forever . and so this is something that maybe a lot of people do n't realize . we actually have california and nevada covered , and we 've got the eastern seaboard from boston to d.c. covered . by the end of this year , you 'll be able to drive from l.a. to new york just using the supercharger network , which charges at five times the rate of anything else . and the key thing is to have a ratio of drive to stop , to stop time , of about six or seven . so if you drive for three hours , you want to stop for 20 or 30 minutes , because that 's normally what people will stop for . so if you start a trip at 9 a.m. , by noon you want to stop to have a bite to eat , hit the restroom , coffee , and keep going . ca : so your proposition to consumers is , for the full charge , it could take an hour . so it 's common -- do n't expect to be out of here in 10 minutes . wait for an hour , but the good news is , you 're helping save the planet , and by the way , the electricity is free . you do n't pay anything . em : actually , what we 're expecting is for people to stop for about 20 to 30 minutes , not for an hour . it 's actually better to drive for about maybe 160 , 170 miles and then stop for half an hour and then keep going . that 's the natural cadence of a trip . ca : all right . so this is only one string to your energy bow . you 've been working on this solar company solarcity . what 's unusual about that ? em : well , as i mentioned earlier , we have to have sustainable electricity production as well as consumption , so i 'm quite confident that the primary means of power generation will be solar . i mean , it 's really indirect fusion , is what it is . we 've got this giant fusion generator in the sky called the sun , and we just need to tap a little bit of that energy for purposes of human civilization . what most people know but do n't realize they know is that the world is almost entirely solar - powered already . if the sun was n't there , we 'd be a frozen ice ball at three degrees kelvin , and the sun powers the entire system of precipitation . the whole ecosystem is solar - powered . ca : but in a gallon of gasoline , you have , effectively , thousands of years of sun power compressed into a small space , so it 's hard to make the numbers work right now on solar , and to remotely compete with , for example , natural gas , fracked natural gas . how are you going to build a business here ? em : well actually , i 'm confident that solar will beat everything , hands down , including natural gas . ca : how ? em : it must , actually . if it does n't , we 're in deep trouble . ca : but you 're not selling solar panels to consumers . what are you doing ? em : no , we actually are . you can buy a solar system or you can lease a solar system . most people choose to lease . and the thing about solar power is that it does n't have any feed stock or operational costs , so once it 's installed , it 's just there . it works for decades . it 'll work for probably a century . so therefore , the key thing to do is to get the cost of that initial installation low , and then get the cost of the financing low , because that interest -- those are the two factors that drive the cost of solar . and we 've made huge progress in that direction , and that 's why i 'm confident we 'll actually beat natural gas . ca : so your current proposition to consumers is , do n't pay so much up front . em : zero . ca : pay zero up front . we will install panels on your roof . you will then pay , how long is a typical lease ? em : typical leases are 20 years , but the value proposition is , as you 're sort of alluding to , quite straightforward . it 's no money down , and your utility bill decreases . pretty good deal . ca : so that seems like a win for the consumer . no risk , you 'll pay less than you 're paying now . for you , the dream here then is that -- i mean , who owns the electricity from those panels for the longer term ? i mean , how do you , the company , benefit ? em : well , essentially , solarcity raises a chunk of capital from say , a company or a bank . google is one of our big partners here . and they have an expected return on that capital . with that capital , solarcity purchases and installs the panel on the roof and then charges the homeowner or business owner a monthly lease payment , which is less than the utility bill . ca : but you yourself get a long - term commercial benefit from that power . you 're kind of building a new type of distributed utility . em : exactly . what it amounts to is a giant distributed utility . i think it 's a good thing , because utilities have been this monopoly , and people have n't had any choice . so effectively it 's the first time there 's been competition for this monopoly , because the utilities have been the only ones that owned those power distribution lines , but now it 's on your roof . so i think it 's actually very empowering for homeowners and businesses . ca : and you really picture a future where a majority of power in america , within a decade or two , or within your lifetime , it goes solar ? em : i 'm extremely confident that solar will be at least a plurality of power , and most likely a majority , and i predict it will be a plurality in less than 20 years . i made that bet with someone -- ca : definition of plurality is ? em : more from solar than any other source . ca : ah . who did you make the bet with ? em : with a friend who will remain nameless . ca : just between us . em : i made that bet , i think , two or three years ago , so in roughly 18 years , i think we 'll see more power from solar than any other source . ca : all right , so let 's go back to another bet that you made with yourself , i guess , a kind of crazy bet . you 'd made some money from the sale of paypal . you decided to build a space company . why on earth would someone do that ? em : i got that question a lot , that 's true . people would say , " did you hear the joke about the guy who made a small fortune in the space industry ? " obviously , " he started with a large one , " is the punchline . and so i tell people , well , i was trying to figure out the fastest way to turn a large fortune into a small one . and they 'd look at me , like , " is he serious ? " ca : and strangely , you were . so what happened ? em : it was a close call . things almost did n't work out . we came very close to failure , but we managed to get through that point in 2008 . the goal of spacex is to try to advance rocket technology , and in particular to try to crack a problem that i think is vital for humanity to become a space - faring civilization , which is to have a rapidly and fully reusable rocket . ca : would humanity become a space - faring civilization ? so that was a dream of yours , in a way , from a young age ? you 've dreamed of mars and beyond ? em : i did build rockets when i was a kid , but i did n't think i 'd be involved in this . it was really more from the standpoint of what are the things that need to happen in order for the future to be an exciting and inspiring one ? and i really think there 's a fundamental difference , if you sort of look into the future , between a humanity that is a space - faring civilization , that 's out there exploring the stars , on multiple planets , and i think that 's really exciting , compared with one where we are forever confined to earth until some eventual extinction event . ca : so you 've somehow slashed the cost of building a rocket by 75 percent , depending on how you calculate it . how on earth have you done that ? nasa has been doing this for years . how have you done this ? em : well , we 've made significant advances in the technology of the airframe , the engines , the electronics and the launch operation . there 's a long list of innovations that we 've come up with there that are a little difficult to communicate in this talk , but -- ca : not least because you could still get copied , right ? you have n't patented this stuff . it 's really interesting to me . em : no , we do n't patent . ca : you did n't patent because you think it 's more dangerous to patent than not to patent . em : since our primary competitors are national governments , the enforceability of patents is questionable . ca : that 's really , really interesting . but the big innovation is still ahead , and you 're working on it now . tell us about this . em : right , so the big innovation -- ca : in fact , let 's roll that video and you can talk us through it , what 's happening here . em : absolutely . so the thing about rockets is that they 're all expendable . all rockets that fly today are fully expendable . the space shuttle was an attempt at a reusable rocket , but even the main tank of the space shuttle was thrown away every time , and the parts that were reusable took a 10,000 - person group nine months to refurbish for flight . so the space shuttle ended up costing a billion dollars per flight . obviously that does n't work very well for -- ca : what just happened there ? we just saw something land ? em : that 's right . so it 's important that the rocket stages be able to come back , to be able to return to the launch site and be ready to launch again within a matter of hours . ca : wow . reusable rockets . em : yes . and so what a lot of people do n't realize is , the cost of the fuel , of the propellant , is very small . it 's much like on a jet . so the cost of the propellant is about .3 percent of the cost of the rocket . so it 's possible to achieve , let 's say , roughly 100 - fold improvement in the cost of spaceflight if you can effectively reuse the rocket . that 's why it 's so important . every mode of transport that we use , whether it 's planes , trains , automobiles , bikes , horses , is reusable , but not rockets . so we must solve this problem in order to become a space - faring civilization . ca : you asked me the question earlier of how popular traveling on cruises would be if you had to burn your ships afterward . em : certain cruises are apparently highly problematic . ca : definitely more expensive . so that 's potentially absolutely disruptive technology , and , i guess , paves the way for your dream to actually take , at some point , to take humanity to mars at scale . you 'd like to see a colony on mars . em : yeah , exactly . spacex , or some combination of companies and governments , needs to make progress in the direction of making life multi - planetary , of establishing a base on another planet , on mars -- being the only realistic option -- and then building that base up until we 're a true multi - planet species . ca : so progress on this " let 's make it reusable , " how is that going ? that was just a simulation video we saw . how 's it going ? em : we 're actually , we 've been making some good progress recently with something we call the grasshopper test project , where we 're testing the vertical landing portion of the flight , the sort of terminal portion which is quite tricky . and we 've had some good tests . ca : can we see that ? em : yeah . so that 's just to give a sense of scale . we dressed a cowboy as johnny cash and bolted the mannequin to the rocket . ca : all right , let 's see that video then , because this is actually amazing when you think about it . you 've never seen this before . a rocket blasting off and then -- em : yeah , so that rocket is about the size of a 12 - story building . so now it 's hovering at about 40 meters , and it 's constantly adjusting the angle , the pitch and yaw of the main engine , and maintaining roll with coal gas thrusters . ca : how cool is that ? elon , how have you done this ? these projects are so -- paypal , solarcity , tesla , spacex , they 're so spectacularly different , they 're such ambitious projects at scale . how on earth has one person been able to innovate in this way ? what is it about you ? em : i do n't know , actually . i do n't have a good answer for you . i work a lot . i mean , a lot . ca : well , i have a theory . em : okay . all right . ca : my theory is that you have an ability to think at a system level of design that pulls together design , technology and business , so if ted was tbd , design , technology and business , into one package , synthesize it in a way that very few people can and -- and this is the critical thing -- feel so damn confident in that clicked - together package that you take crazy risks . you bet your fortune on it , and you seem to have done that multiple times . i mean , almost no one can do that . is that -- could we have some of that secret sauce ? can we put it into our education system ? can someone learn from you ? it is truly amazing what you 've done . em : well , thanks . thank you . well , i do think there 's a good framework for thinking . it is physics . you know , the sort of first principles reasoning . generally i think there are -- what i mean by that is , boil things down to their fundamental truths and reason up from there , as opposed to reasoning by analogy . through most of our life , we get through life by reasoning by analogy , which essentially means copying what other people do with slight variations . and you have to do that . otherwise , mentally , you would n't be able to get through the day . but when you want to do something new , you have to apply the physics approach . physics is really figuring out how to discover new things that are counterintuitive , like quantum mechanics . it 's really counterintuitive . so i think that 's an important thing to do , and then also to really pay attention to negative feedback , and solicit it , particularly from friends . this may sound like simple advice , but hardly anyone does that , and it 's incredibly helpful . ca : boys and girls watching , study physics . learn from this man . elon musk , i wish we had all day , but thank you so much for coming to ted . em : thank you . ca : that was awesome . that was really , really cool . look at that . just take a bow . that was fantastic . thank you so much .

' they were q - tip white , bright and blinding my eyes . the red emblem of michael looked as if it could fly . not one spot of dirt . the airs were brand new . had my pistol and knew just what to do . waited until it was just the right time , followed him very closely behind . he made a left turn on houston , i pulled out my gun , and i said , ' gimme them jordans ! ' and the punk tried to run . took off fast , did n't get far . i fired , ' pow ! ' fool fell between two parked cars . he was coughing , crying , blood spilled on the street . and i snatched them air jordans off of his feet . while laying there dying , all he could say was , " please man , do n't take my air jordans away . " you 'd think he 'd be worried about staying alive . as i took off with his sneakers , there was tears in his eyes . very next day , i bopped into school with my brand new air jordans , man , i was cool . i killed to get ' em , but hey , i do n't care , because now i needs a new jacket to wear . " thank you . for the last 15 years that i have been performing , all i ever wanted to do was transcend poetry to the world . see , it was n't enough for me to write a book . it was n't enough for me to join a slam competition , and while those things hold weight , it was n't the driving force that pushes the pen to the pad . the hunger and thirst was , and still remains : how do i get people who hate poetry to love me ? because i 'm an extension of my work , and if they love me , then they will love my work , and if they love my work , then they will love poetry , and if they love poetry , then i will have done my job , which is to transcend it to the world . and in 1996 , i found the answer in principles in a master spoken - word artist named reg e. gaines , who wrote the famous poem , " please do n't take my air jordans . " and i followed this guy everywhere until i had him in the room , and i read him one of my pieces , and you know what he told me ? " yo ' wack . you know what the problem is with you , homie ? you do n't read other people 's poetry , and you do n't got any subordination for verbal measures to tonal consideration . " now he kept on rambling about poetry and styles and nuyorican friday nights . now i could have quit . i should have quit . i mean , i thought poetry was just self - expression . i did n't know you actually have to have creative control . so instead of quitting , i followed him everywhere . when he was writing a broadway show , i would be outside of the door . i would wake him up at , like , 6:30 in the morning to ask him who 's the best poet . i remember eating the eyes of a fish right out of the sea because he told me it was brain food . then one day i told him , " reg e. , what is subordination for verbal measures to tonal consideration ? " and he handed me a black - and - white printed out thesis on a poet named etheridge knight and the oral nature of poetry , and from that point , reggie stopped becoming the best to me , because what etheridge knight taught me was that i could make my words sound like music , even my small ones , the monosyllables , the ifs , ands , buts , whats , the gangsta in my slang could fall right on the ear , and from then on , i started chasing etheridge knight . i wanted to know which poet he read , and i landed on a poem called [ " dark prophecy : sing of shine " ] , a toast signifying that got me on the biggest stage a poet could ever be : broadway , baby . and from that point , i learned how to pull the mic away and attack the poetry with my body . but that was n't the biggest lesson i ever learned . the biggest lesson i learned was many years later when i went to beverly hills and i ran into a talent agent who looked at me up and down and said i do n't look like i have any experience to be working in this business . and i said to him , " listen , punk fool , you 're a failed actor who became an agent , and you know why you failed as an actor ? because people like me took your job . i 've traveled all the way from cleveland and essex in east new york , took the local 6 line up to the hookers of hunt 's point who were in my way on my way to master the art of space , and the one - to - infinite amount of man , woman and child you can fit in there only so i can push them to the back of the wall with my experience . people have bought tickets to my experience and used them as refrigerator magnets to let them know that the revolution is near , so stock up . i 'm so experienced that when you went to a privileged school to learn a shakespearean sonnet , i was getting those beats kicked and shoved into me . i can master shock of " the crying game " with the awe of a child being called an aids victim by a bully who did n't know that it was his father who gave it to my mother , and that 's a double entendre . i 'm so experienced that when you went to the fell school and all the rich little fairy boys decided to sponsor a child in it , that was me , but kicked me out when i was caught teaching the fairy boys how to rob the pats off a pair of lee jeans and bring them to vim . let me see chekhov pull that off . sanford meisner was my uncle artie yelling silently to himself , " something 's always wrong when nothing 's always right . " method acting is nothing but a mixture of multiple personalities , believing your own lies are reality , like in high school cool kenny telling me he wanted to be a cop . dude , you go to riker 's island academy . i could make david mamet psychoanalyze my attack on dialogue , stanislavski be as if he were bruce lee kicking your roster of talentless students up and down crenshaw . so what , your actors studied guerrilla theater at the london rep ? let me tell you an ancient chinese saturday afternoon kung fu secret . boards do n't hit back . you think black entertainers have it hard finding work in this business ? i 'm a suspicious mulatto , which means i 'm too black to be white and too white to be doing it right . forget the american ghetto . i 've cracked stages in soweto , buried abortion babies in potter 's field and still managed to keep a smile on my face , so whatever you curse at me to your caddyshack go - for - this , go - for - that assistant when i walk out that door , whatever slander you send my way , your mother . thank you .
technology business	i 've always written primarily about architecture , about buildings , and writing about architecture is based on certain assumptions . an architect designs a building , and it becomes a place , or many architects design many buildings , and it becomes a city , and regardless of this complicated mix of forces of politics and culture and economics that shapes these places , at the end of the day , you can go and you can visit them . you can walk around them . you can smell them . you can get a feel for them . you can experience their sense of place . but what was striking to me over the last several years was that less and less was i going out into the world , and more and more , i was sitting in front of my computer screen . and especially since about 2007 , when i got an iphone , i was not only sitting in front of my screen all day , but i was also getting up at the end of the day and looking at this little screen that i carried in my pocket . and what was surprising to me was how quickly my relationship to the physical world had changed . in this very short period of time , you know , whether you call it the last 15 years or so of being online , or the last , you know , four or five years of being online all the time , our relationship to our surroundings had changed in that our attention is constantly divided . you know , we 're both looking inside the screens and we 're looking out in the world around us . and what was even more striking to me , and what i really got hung up on , was that the world inside the screen seemed to have no physical reality of its own . if you went and looked for images of the internet , this was all that you found , this famous image by opte of the internet as the kind of milky way , this infinite expanse where we do n't seem to be anywhere on it . we can never seem to grasp it in its totality . it 's always reminded me of the apollo image of the earth , the blue marble picture , and it 's similarly meant to suggest , i think , that we ca n't really understand it as a whole . we 're always sort of small in the face of its expanse . so if there was this world and this screen , and if there was the physical world around me , i could n't ever get them together in the same place . and then this happened . my internet broke one day , as it occasionally does , and the cable guy came to fix it , and he started with the dusty clump of cables behind the couch , and he followed it to the front of my building and into the basement and out to the back yard , and there was this big jumble of cables against the wall . and then he saw a squirrel running along the wire , and he said , " there 's your problem . a squirrel is chewing on your internet . " and this seemed astounding . the internet is a transcendent idea . it 's a set of protocols that has changed everything from shopping to dating to revolutions . it was unequivocally not something a squirrel could chew on . but that in fact seemed to be the case . a squirrel had in fact chewed on my internet . and then i got this image in my head of what would happen if you yanked the wire from the wall and if you started to follow it . where would it go ? was the internet actually a place that you could visit ? could i go there ? who would i meet ? you know , was there something actually out there ? and the answer , by all accounts , was no. this was the internet , this black box with a red light on it , as represented in the sitcom " the it crowd . " normally it lives on the top of big ben , because that 's where you get the best reception , but they had negotiated that their colleague could borrow it for the afternoon to use in an office presentation . the elders of the internet were willing to part with it for a short while , and she looks at it and she says , " this is the internet ? the whole internet ? is it heavy ? " they say , " of course not , the internet does n't weigh anything . " and i was embarrassed . i was looking for this thing that only fools seem to look for . the internet was that amorphous blob , or it was a silly black box with a blinking red light on it . it was n't a real world out there . but , in fact , it is . there is a real world of the internet out there , and that 's what i spent about two years visiting , these places of the internet . i was in large data centers that use as much power as the cities in which they sit , and i visited places like this , 60 hudson street in new york , which is one of the buildings in the world , one of a very short list of buildings , about a dozen buildings , where more networks of the internet connect to each other than anywhere else . and that connection is an unequivocally physical process . it 's about the router of one network , a facebook or a google or a b.t. or a comcast or a time warner , whatever it is , connecting with usually a yellow fiber - optic cable up into the ceiling and down into the router of another network , and that 's unequivocally physical , and it 's surprisingly intimate . a building like 60 hudson , and a dozen or so others , has 10 times more networks connecting within it than the next tier of buildings . there 's a very short list of these places . and 60 hudson in particular is interesting because it 's home to about a half a dozen very important networks , which are the networks which serve the undersea cables that travel underneath the ocean that connect europe and america and connect all of us . and it 's those cables in particular that i want to focus on . if the internet is a global phenomenon , if we live in a global village , it 's because there are cables underneath the ocean , cables like this . and in this dimension , they are incredibly small . you can you hold them in your hand . they 're like a garden hose . but in the other dimension they are incredibly expansive , as expansive as you can imagine . they stretch across the ocean . they 're three or five or eight thousand miles in length , and if the material science and the computational technology is incredibly complicated , the basic physical process is shockingly simple . light goes in on one end of the ocean and comes out on the other , and it usually comes from a building called a landing station that 's often tucked away inconspicuously in a little seaside neighborhood , and there are amplifiers that sit on the ocean floor that look kind of like bluefin tuna , and every 50 miles they amplify the signal , and since the rate of transmission is incredibly fast , the basic unit is a 10 - gigabit - per - second wavelength of light , maybe a thousand times your own connection , or capable of carrying 10,000 video streams , but not only that , but you 'll put not just one wavelength of light through one of the fibers , but you 'll put maybe 50 or 60 or 70 different wavelengths or colors of light through a single fiber , and then you 'll have maybe eight fibers in a cable , four going in each direction . and they 're tiny . they 're the thickness of a hair . and then they connect to the continent somewhere . they connect in a manhole like this . literally , this is where the 5,000 - mile cable plugs in . this is in halifax , a cable that stretches from halifax to ireland . and the landscape is changing . three years ago , when i started thinking about this , there was one cable down the western coast of africa , represented in this map by steve song as that thin black line . now there are six cables and more coming , three down each coast . because once a country gets plugged in by one cable , they realize that it 's not enough . if they 're going to build an industry around it , they need to know that their connection is n't tenuous but permanent , because if a cable breaks , you have to send a ship out into the water , throw a grappling hook over the side , pick it up , find the other end , and then fuse the two ends back together and then dump it over . it 's an intensely , intensely physical process . so this is my friend simon cooper , who until very recently worked for tata communications , the communications wing of tata , the big indian industrial conglomerate . and i 've never met him . we 've only communicated via this telepresence system , which always makes me think of him as the man inside the internet . and he is english . the undersea cable industry is dominated by englishmen , and they all seem to be 42 . because they all started at the same time with the boom about 20 years ago . and tata had gotten its start as a communications business when they bought two cables , one across the atlantic and one across the pacific , and proceeded to add pieces onto them , until they had built a belt around the world , which means they will send your bits to the east or the west . they have -- this is literally a beam of light around the world , and if a cable breaks in the pacific , it 'll send it around the other direction . and then having done that , they started to look for places to wire next . they looked for the unwired places , and that 's meant north and south , primarily these cables to africa . but what amazes me is simon 's incredible geographic imagination . he thinks about the world with this incredible expansiveness . and i was particularly interested because i wanted to see one of these cables being built . see , you know , all the time online we experience these fleeting moments of connection , these sort of brief adjacencies , a tweet or a facebook post or an email , and it seemed like there was a physical corollary to that . it seemed like there was a moment when the continent was being plugged in , and i wanted to see that . and simon was working on a new cable , wacs , the west africa cable system , that stretched from lisbon down the west coast of africa , to cote d'ivoire , to ghana , to nigeria , to cameroon . and he said there was coming soon , depending on the weather , but he 'd let me know when , and so with about four days notice , he said to go to this beach south of lisbon , and a little after 9 , this guy will walk out of the water . and he 'll be carrying a green nylon line , a lightweight line , called a messenger line , and that was the first link between sea and land , this link that would then be leveraged into this 9,000 - mile path of light . then a bulldozer began to pull the cable in from this specialized cable landing ship , and it was floated on these buoys until it was in the right place . then you can see the english engineers looking on . and then , once it was in the right place , he got back in the water holding a big knife , and he cut each buoy off , and the buoy popped up into the air , and the cable dropped to the sea floor , and he did that all the way out to the ship , and when he got there , they gave him a glass of juice and a cookie , and then he jumped back in , and he swam back to shore , and then he lit a cigarette . and then once that cable was on shore , they began to prepare to connect it to the other side , for the cable that had been brought down from the landing station . and first they got it with a hacksaw , and then they start sort of shaving away at this plastic interior with a -- sort of working like chefs , and then finally they 're working like jewelers to get these hair - thin fibers to line up with the cable that had come down , and with this hole - punch machine they fuse it together . and when you see these guys going at this cable with a hacksaw , you stop thinking about the internet as a cloud . it starts to seem like an incredibly physical thing . and what surprised me as well was that as much as this is based on the most sophisticated technology , as much as this is an incredibly new thing , the physical process itself has been around for a long time , and the culture is the same . you see the local laborers . you see the english engineer giving directions in the background . and more importantly , the places are the same . these cables still connect these classic port cities , places like lisbon , mombasa , mumbai , singapore , new york . and then the process on shore takes around three or four days , and then , when it 's done , they put the manhole cover back on top , and they push the sand over that , and we all forget about it . and it seems to me that we talk a lot about the cloud , but every time we put something on the cloud , we give up some responsibility for it . we are less connected to it . we let other people worry about it . and that does n't seem right . there 's a great neal stephenson line where he says that wired people should know something about wires . and we should know , i think , we should know where our internet comes from , and we should know what it is that physically , physically connects us all . thank you . thanks .
technology	today i 'm going to show you an electric vehicle that weighs less than a bicycle , that you can carry with you anywhere , that you can charge off a normal wall outlet in 15 minutes , and you can run it for 1,000 kilometers on about a dollar of electricity . but when i say the word electric vehicle , people think about vehicles . they think about cars and motorcycles and bicycles , and the vehicles that you use every day . but if you come about it from a different perspective , you can create some more interesting , more novel concepts . so we built something . i 've got some of the pieces in my pocket here . so this is the motor . this motor has enough power to take you up the hills of san francisco at about 20 miles per hour , about 30 kilometers an hour , and this battery , this battery right here has about six miles of range , or 10 kilometers , which is enough to cover about half of the car trips in the u.s. alone . but the best part about these components is that we bought them at a toy store . these are from remote control airplanes . and the performance of these things has gotten so good that if you think about vehicles a little bit differently , you can really change things . so today we 're going to show you one example of how you can use this . pay attention to not only how fun this thing is , but also how the portability that comes with this can totally change the way you interact with a city like san francisco . [ 6 mile range ] [ top speed near 20mph ] [ uphill climbing ] [ regenerative braking ] so we 're going to show you what this thing can do . it 's really maneuverable . you have a hand - held remote , so you can pretty easily control acceleration , braking , go in reverse if you like , also have braking . it 's incredible just how light this thing is . i mean , this is something you can pick up and carry with you anywhere you go . so i 'll leave you with one of the most compelling facts about this technology and these kinds of vehicles . this uses 20 times less energy for every mile or kilometer that you travel than a car , which means not only is this thing fast to charge and really cheap to build , but it also reduces the footprint of your energy use in terms of your transportation . so instead of looking at large amounts of energy needed for each person in this room to get around in a city , now you can look at much smaller amounts and more sustainable transportation . so next time you think about a vehicle , i hope , like us , you 're thinking about something new . thank you .
art creativity	we 're going to begin in 1964 . bob dylan is 23 years old , and his career is just reaching its pinnacle . he 's been christened the voice of a generation , and he 's churning out classic songs at a seemingly impossible rate , but there 's a small minority of dissenters , and they claim that bob dylan is stealing other people 's songs . 2004 . brian burton , aka danger mouse , takes the beatles ' " white album , " combines it with jay - z 's " the black album " to create " the grey album . " " the grey album " becomes an immediate sensation online , and the beatles ' record company sends out countless cease - and - desist letters for " unfair competition and dilution of our valuable property . " now , " the grey album " is a remix . it is new media created from old media . it was made using these three techniques : copy , transform and combine . it 's how you remix . you take existing songs , you chop them up , you transform the pieces , you combine them back together again , and you 've got a new song , but that new song is clearly comprised of old songs . but i think these are n't just the components of remixing . i think these are the basic elements of all creativity . i think everything is a remix , and i think this is a better way to conceive of creativity . all right , let 's head back to 1964 , and let 's hear where some of dylan 's early songs came from . we 'll do some side - by - side comparisons here . all right , this first song you 're going to hear is " nottamun town . " it 's a traditional folk tune . after that , you 'll hear dylan 's " masters of war . " jean ritchie : ♫ in nottamun town , not a soul would look out , ♫ ♫ not a soul would look up , not a soul would look down . ♫ bob dylan : ♫ come you masters of war , ♫ ♫ you that build the big guns , you that build the death planes , ♫ ♫ you that build all the bombs . ♫ kirby ferguson : okay , so that 's the same basic melody and overall structure . this next one is " the patriot game , " by dominic behan . alongside that , you 're going to hear " with god on our side , " by dylan . dominic behan : ♫ come all ye young rebels , ♫ ♫ and list while i sing , ♫ ♫ for the love of one 's land is a terrible thing . ♫ bd : ♫ oh my name it is nothin ' , ♫ ♫ my age it means less , ♫ ♫ the country i come from is called the midwest . ♫ kf : okay , so in this case , dylan admits he must have heard " the patriot game , " he forgot about it , then when the song kind of bubbled back up in his brain , he just thought it was his song . last one , this is " who 's going to buy you ribbons , " another traditional folk tune . alongside that is " do n't think twice , it 's all right . " this one 's more about the lyric . paul clayton : ♫ it ai n't no use to sit and sigh now , ♫ ♫ darlin ' , and it ai n't no use to sit and cry now . ♫ bd : ♫ it ai n't no use to sit and wonder why , babe , ♫ ♫ if you do n't know by now , ♫ ♫ and it ai n't no use to sit and wonder why , babe , ♫ ♫ it 'll never do somehow . ♫ kf : okay , now , there 's a lot of these . it 's been estimated that two thirds of the melodies dylan used in his early songs were borrowed . this is pretty typical among folk singers . here 's the advice of dylan 's idol , woody guthrie . " the worlds are the important thing . do n't worry about tunes . take a tune , sing high when they sing low , sing fast when they sing slow , and you 've got a new tune . " and that 's , that 's what guthrie did right here , and i 'm sure you all recognize the results . we know this tune , right ? we know it ? actually you do n't . that is " when the world 's on fire , " a very old melody , in this case performed by the carter family . guthrie adapted it into " this land is your land . " so , bob dylan , like all folk singers , he copied melodies , he transformed them , he combined them with new lyrics which were frequently their own concoction of previous stuff . now , american copyright and patent laws run counter to this notion that we build on the work of others . instead , these laws and laws around the world use the rather awkward analogy of property . now , creative works may indeed be kind of like property , but it 's property that we 're all building on , and creations can only take root and grow once that ground has been prepared . henry ford once said , " i invented nothing new . i simply assembled the discoveries of other men behind whom were centuries of work . progress happens when all the factors that make for it are ready and then it is inevitable . " 2007 . the iphone makes it debut . apple undoubtedly brings this innovation to us early , but its time was approaching because its core technology had been evolving for decades . that 's multi - touch , controlling a device by touching its display . here is steve jobs introducing multi - touch and making a rather foreboding joke . steve jobs : and we have invented a new technology called multi - touch . you can do multi - fingered gestures on it , and boy have we patented it . kf : yes . and yet , here is multi - touch in action . this is at ted , actually , about a year earlier . this is jeff han , and , i mean , that 's multi - touch . it 's the same animal , at least . let 's hear what jeff han has to say about this newfangled technology . jeff han : multi - touch sensing is n't anything -- is n't completely new . i mean , people like bill buxton have been playing around with it in the '80s . the technology , you know , is n't the most exciting thing here right now other than probably its newfound accessibility . kf : so he 's pretty frank about it not being new . so it 's not multi - touch as a whole that 's patented . it 's the small parts of it that are , and it 's in these small details where we can clearly see patent law contradicting its intent : to promote the progress of useful arts . here is the first ever slide - to - unlock . that is all there is to it . apple has patented this . it 's a 28 - page software patent , but i will summarize what it covers . spoiler alert : unlocking your phone by sliding an icon with your finger . i 'm only exaggerating a little bit . it 's a broad patent . now , can someone own this idea ? now , back in the '80s , there were no software patents , and it was xerox that pioneered the graphical user interface . what if they had patented pop - up menus , scrollbars , the desktop with icons that look like folders and sheets of paper ? would a young and inexperienced apple have survived the legal assault from a much larger and more mature company like xerox ? now , this idea that everything is a remix might sound like common sense until you 're the one getting remixed . for example ... sj : i mean , picasso had a saying . he said , " good artists copy . great artists steal . " and we have , you know , always been shameless about stealing great ideas . kf : okay , so that 's in '96 . here 's in 2010 . " i 'm going to destroy android because it 's a stolen product . " " i 'm willing to go thermonuclear war on this . " okay , so in other words , great artists steal , but not from me . now , behavioral economists might refer to this sort of thing as loss aversion we have a strong predisposition towards protecting what we feel is ours . we have no such aversion towards copying what other people have , because we do that nonstop . so here 's the sort of equation we 're looking at . we 've got laws that fundamentally treat creative works as property , plus massive rewards or settlements in infringement cases , plus huge legal fees to protect yourself in court , plus cognitive biases against perceived loss . and the sum looks like this . that is the last four years of lawsuits in the realm of smartphones . is this promoting the progress of useful arts ? 1983 . bob dylan is 42 years old , and his time in the cultural spotlight is long since past . he records a song called " blind willie mctell , " named after the blues singer , and the song is a voyage through the past , through a much darker time , but a simpler one , a time when musicians like willie mctell had few illusions about what they did . " i jump ' em from other writers but i arrange ' em my own way . " i think this is mostly what we do . our creativity comes from without , not from within . we are not self - made . we are dependent on one another , and admitting this to ourselves is n't an embrace of mediocrity and derivativeness . it 's a liberation from our misconceptions , and it 's an incentive to not expect so much from ourselves and to simply begin . thank you so much . it was an honor to be here . thank you . thank you . thank you . thank you .
technology	i 'm here to show you how something you ca n't see can be so much fun to look at . you 're about to experience a new , available and exciting technology that 's going to make us rethink how we waterproof our lives . what i have here is a cinder block that we 've coated half with a nanotechnology spray that can be applied to almost any material . it 's called ultra - ever dry , and when you apply it to any material , it turns into a superhydrophobic shield . so this is a cinder block , uncoated , and you can see that it 's porous , it absorbs water . not anymore . porous , nonporous . so what 's superhydrophobic ? superhydrophobic is how we measure a drop of water on a surface . the rounder it is , the more hydrophobic it is , and if it 's really round , it 's superhydrophobic . a freshly waxed car , the water molecules slump to about 90 degrees . a windshield coating is going to give you about 110 degrees . but what you 're seeing here is 160 to 175 degrees , and anything over 150 is superhydrophobic . so as part of the demonstration , what i have is a pair of gloves , and we 've coated one of the gloves with the nanotechnology coating , and let 's see if you can tell which one , and i 'll give you a hint . did you guess the one that was dry ? when you have nanotechnology and nanoscience , what 's occurred is that we 're able to now look at atoms and molecules and actually control them for great benefits . and we 're talking really small here . the way you measure nanotechnology is in nanometers , and one nanometer is a billionth of a meter , and to put some scale to that , if you had a nanoparticle that was one nanometer thick , and you put it side by side , and you had 50,000 of them , you 'd be the width of a human hair . so very small , but very useful . and it 's not just water that this works with . it 's a lot of water - based materials like concrete , water - based paint , mud , and also some refined oils as well . you can see the difference . moving onto the next demonstration , we 've taken a pane of glass and we 've coated the outside of it , we 've framed it with the nanotechnology coating , and we 're going to pour this green - tinted water inside the middle , and you 're going to see , it 's going to spread out on glass like you 'd normally think it would , except when it hits the coating , it stops , and i ca n't even coax it to leave . it 's that afraid of the water . so what 's going on here ? what 's happening ? well , the surface of the spray coating is actually filled with nanoparticles that form a very rough and craggly surface . you 'd think it 'd be smooth , but it 's actually not . and it has billions of interstitial spaces , and those spaces , along with the nanoparticles , reach up and grab the air molecules , and cover the surface with air . it 's an umbrella of air all across it , and that layer of air is what the water hits , the mud hits , the concrete hits , and it glides right off . so if i put this inside this water here , you can see a silver reflective coating around it , and that silver reflective coating is the layer of air that 's protecting the water from touching the paddle , and it 's dry . so what are the applications ? i mean , many of you right now are probably going through your head . everyone that sees this gets excited , and says , " oh , i could use it for this and this and this . " the applications in a general sense could be anything that 's anti - wetting . we 've certainly seen that today . it could be anything that 's anti - icing , because if you do n't have water , you do n't have ice . it could be anti - corrosion . no water , no corrosion . it could be anti - bacterial . without water , the bacteria wo n't survive . and it could be things that need to be self - cleaning as well . so imagine how something like this could help revolutionize your field of work . and i 'm going to leave you with one last demonstration , but before i do that , i would like to say thank you , and think small . it 's going to happen . wait for it . wait for it . chris anderson : you guys did n't hear about us cutting out the design from ted ? [ two minutes later ... ] he ran into all sorts of problems in terms of managing the medical research part . it 's happening !
education	i 'm a brain scientist , and as a brain scientist , i 'm actually interested in how the brain learns , and i 'm especially interested in a possibility of making our brains smarter , better and faster . this is in this context i 'm going to tell you about video games . when we say video games , most of you think about children . it 's true . ninety percent of children do play video games . but let 's be frank . when the kids are in bed , who is in front of the playstation ? most of you . the average age of a gamer is 33 years old , not eight years old , and in fact , if we look at the projected demographics of video game play , the video game players of tomorrow are older adults . so video [ gaming ] is pervasive throughout our society . it is clearly here to stay . it has an amazing impact on our everyday life . consider these statistics released by activision . after one month of release of the game " call of duty : black ops , " it had been played for 68,000 years worldwide , right ? would any of you complain if this was the case about doing linear algebra ? so what we are asking in the lab is , how can we leverage that power ? now i want to step back a bit . i know most of you have had the experience of coming back home and finding your kids playing these kinds of games . the name of the game is to get after your enemy zombie bad guys before they get to you , right ? and i 'm almost sure most of you have thought , " oh , come on , ca n't you do something more intelligent than shooting at zombies ? " i 'd like you to put this kind of knee - jerk reaction in the context of what you would have thought if you had found your girl playing sudoku or your boy reading shakespeare . right ? most parents would find that great . well , i 'm not going to tell you that playing video games days in and days out is actually good for your health . it 's not , and binging is never good . but i 'm going to argue that in reasonable doses , actually the very game i showed you at the beginning , those action - packed shooter games have quite powerful effects and positive effects on many different aspects of our behavior . there 's not one week that goes without some major headlines in the media about whether video games are good or bad for you , right ? you 're all bombarded with that . i 'd like to put this kind of friday night bar discussion aside and get you to actually step into the lab. what we do in the lab is actually measure directly , in a quantitative fashion , what is the impact of video games on the brain . and so i 'm going to take a few examples from our work . one first saying that i 'm sure you all have heard is the fact that too much screen time makes your eyesight worse . that 's a statement about vision . there may be vision scientists among you . we actually know how to test that statement . we can step into the lab and measure how good your vision is . well , guess what ? people that do n't play a lot of action games , that do n't actually spend a lot of time in front of screens , have normal , or what we call corrective - to - normal vision . that 's okay . the issue is what happens with these guys that actually indulge into playing video games like five hours per week , 10 hours per week , 15 hours per week . by that statement , their vision should be really bad , right ? guess what ? their vision is really , really good . it 's better than those that do n't play . and it 's better in two different ways . the first way is that they 're actually able to resolve small detail in the context of clutter , and though that means being able to read the fine print on a prescription rather than using magnifier glasses , you can actually do it with just your eyesight . the other way that they are better is actually being able to resolve different levels of gray . imagine you 're driving in a fog . that makes a difference between seeing the car in front of you and avoiding the accident , or getting into an accident . so we 're actually leveraging that work to develop games for patients with low vision , and to have an impact on retraining their brain to see better . clearly , when it comes to action video games , screen time does n't make your eyesight worse . another saying that i 'm sure you have all heard around : video games lead to attention problems and greater distractability . okay , we know how to measure attention in the lab. i 'm actually going to give you an example of how we do so . i 'm going to ask you to participate , so you 're going to have to actually play the game with me . i 'm going to show you colored words . i want you to shout out the color of the ink . right ? so this is the first example . [ " chair " ] orange , good . [ " table " ] green . [ " board " ] audience : red . daphne bavelier : red . [ " horse " ] db : yellow . audience : yellow . [ " yellow " ] db : red . audience : yellow . [ " blue " ] db : yellow . okay , you get my point , right ? you 're getting better , but it 's hard . why is it hard ? because i introduced a conflict between the word itself and its color . how good your attention is determines actually how fast you resolve that conflict , so the young guys here at the top of their game probably , like , did a little better than some of us that are older . what we can show is that when you do this kind of task with people that play a lot of action games , they actually resolve the conflict faster . so clearly playing those action games does n't lead to attention problems . actually , those action video game players have many other advantages in terms of attention , and one aspect of attention which is also improved for the better is our ability to track objects around in the world . this is something we use all the time . when you 're driving , you 're tracking , keeping track of the cars around you . you 're also keeping track of the pedestrian , the running dog , and that 's how you can actually be safe driving , right ? in the lab , we get people to come to the lab , sit in front of a computer screen , and we give them little tasks that i 'm going to get you to do again . you 're going to see yellow happy faces and a few sad blue faces . these are children in the schoolyard in geneva during a recess during the winter . most kids are happy . it 's actually recess . but a few kids are sad and blue because they 've forgotten their coat . everybody begins to move around , and your task is to keep track of who had a coat at the beginning and who did n't . so i 'm just going to show you an example where there is only one sad kid . it 's easy because you can actually track it with your eyes . you can track , you can track , and then when it stops , and there is a question mark , and i ask you , did this kid have a coat or not ? was it yellow initially or blue ? i hear a few yellow . good . so most of you have a brain . i 'm now going to ask you to do the task , but now with a little more challenging task . there are going to be three of them that are blue . do n't move your eyes . please do n't move your eyes . keep your eyes fixated and expand , pull your attention . that 's the only way you can actually do it . if you move your eyes , you 're doomed . yellow or blue ? audience : yellow . db : good . so your typical normal young adult can have a span of about three or four objects of attention . that 's what we just did . your action video game player has a span of about six to seven objects of attention , which is what is shown in this video here . that 's for you guys , action video game players . a bit more challenging , right ? yellow or blue ? blue . we have some people that are serious out there . yeah . good . so in the same way that we actually see the effects of video games on people 's behavior , we can use brain imaging and look at the impact of video games on the brain , and we do find many changes , but the main changes are actually to the brain networks that control attention . so one part is the parietal cortex which is very well known to control the orientation of attention . the other one is the frontal lobe , which controls how we sustain attention , and another one is the anterior cingulate , which controls how we allocate and regulate attention and resolve conflict . now , when we do brain imaging , we find that all three of these networks are actually much more efficient in people that play action games . this actually leads me to a rather counterintuitive finding in the literature about technology and the brain . you all know about multitasking . you all have been faulty of multitasking when you 're driving and you pick up your cellphone . bad idea . very bad idea . why ? because as your attention shifts to your cell phone , you are actually losing the capacity to react swiftly to the car braking in front of you , and so you 're much more likely to get engaged into a car accident . now , we can measure that kind of skills in the lab. we obviously do n't ask people to drive around and see how many car accidents they have . that would be a little costly proposition . but we design tasks on the computer where we can measure , to millisecond accuracy , how good they are at switching from one task to another . when we do that , we actually find that people that play a lot of action games are really , really good . they switch really fast , very swiftly . they pay a very small cost . now i 'd like you to remember that result , and put it in the context of another group of technology users , a group which is actually much revered by society , which are people that engage in multimedia - tasking . what is multimedia - tasking ? it 's the fact that most of us , most of our children , are engaged with listening to music at the same time as they 're doing search on the web at the same time as they 're chatting on facebook with their friends . that 's a multimedia - tasker . there was a first study done by colleagues at stanford and that we replicated that showed that those people that identify as being high multimedia - taskers are absolutely abysmal at multitasking . when we measure them in the lab , they 're really bad . right ? so these kinds of results really makes two main points . the first one is that not all media are created equal . you ca n't compare the effect of multimedia - tasking and the effect of playing action games . they have totally different effects on different aspects of cognition , perception and attention . even within video games , i 'm telling you right now about these action - packed video games . different video games have a different effect on your brains . so we actually need to step into the lab and really measure what is the effect of each video game . the other lesson is that general wisdom carries no weight . i showed that to you already , like we looked at the fact that despite a lot of screen time , those action gamers have a lot of very good vision , etc. here , what was really striking is that these undergraduates that actually report engaging in a lot of high multimedia - tasking are convinced they aced the test . so you show them their data , you show them they are bad and they 're like , " not possible . " you know , they have this sort of gut feeling that , really , they are doing really , really good . that 's another argument for why we need to step into the lab and really measure the impact of technology on the brain . now in a sense , when we think about the effect of video games on the brain , it 's very similar to the effect of wine on the health . there are some very poor uses of wine . there are some very poor uses of video games . but when consumed in reasonable doses , and at the right age , wine can be very good for health . there are actually specific molecules that have been identified in red wine as leading to greater life expectancy . so it 's the same way , like those action video games have a number of ingredients that are actually really powerful for brain plasticity , learning , attention , vision , etc. , and so we need and we 're working on understanding what are those active ingredients so that we can really then leverage them to deliver better games , either for education or for rehabilitation of patients . now because we are interested in having an impact for education or rehabilitation of patients , we are actually not that interested in how those of you that choose to play video games for many hours on end perform . i 'm much more interested in taking any of you and showing that by forcing you to play an action game , i can actually change your vision for the better , whether you want to play that action game or not , right ? that 's the point of rehabilitation or education . most of the kids do n't go to school saying , " great , two hours of math ! " so that 's really the crux of the research , and to do that , we need to go one more step . and one more step is to do training studies . so let me illustrate that step with a task which is called mental rotation . mental rotation is a task where i 'm going to ask you , and again you 're going to do the task , to look at this shape . study it , it 's a target shape , and i 'm going to present to you four different shapes . one of these four different shapes is actually a rotated version of this shape . i want you to tell me which one : the first one , second one , third one or fourth one ? okay , i 'll help you . fourth one . one more . get those brains working . come on . that 's our target shape . third . good ! this is hard , right ? like , the reason that i asked you to do that is because you really feel your brain cringing , right ? it does n't really feel like playing mindless action video games . well , what we do in these training studies is , people come to the lab , they do tasks like this one , we then force them to play 10 hours of action games . they do n't play 10 hours of action games in a row . they do distributed practice , so little shots of 40 minutes several days over a period of two weeks . then , once they are done with the training , they come back a few days later and they are tested again on a similar type of mental rotation task . so this is work from a colleague in toronto . what they showed is that , initially , you know , subjects perform where they are expected to perform given their age . after two weeks of training on action video games , they actually perform better , and the improvement is still there five months after having done the training . that 's really , really important . why ? because i told you we want to use these games for education or for rehabilitation . we need to have effects that are going to be long - lasting . now , at this point , a number of you are probably wondering well , what are you waiting for , to put on the market a game that would be good for the attention of my grandmother and that she would actually enjoy , or a game that would be great to rehabilitate the vision of my grandson who has amblyopia , for example ? well , we 're working on it , but here is a challenge . there are brain scientists like me that are beginning to understand what are the good ingredients in games to promote positive effects , and that 's what i 'm going to call the broccoli side of the equation . there is an entertainment software industry which is extremely deft at coming up with appealing products that you ca n't resist . that 's the chocolate side of the equation . the issue is we need to put the two together , and it 's a little bit like with food . who really wants to eat chocolate - covered broccoli ? none of you . and you probably have had that feeling , right , picking up an education game and sort of feeling , hmm , you know , it 's not really fun , it 's not really engaging . so what we need is really a new brand of chocolate , a brand of chocolate that is irresistible , that you really want to play , but that has all the ingredients , the good ingredients that are extracted from the broccoli that you ca n't recognize but are still working on your brains . and we 're working on it , but it takes brain scientists to come and to get together , people that work in the entertainment software industry , and publishers , so these are not people that usually meet every day , but it 's actually doable , and we are on the right track . i 'd like to leave you with that thought , and thank you for your attention .
science biology health	i 'm going to start with a little story . so , i grew up in this neighborhood . when i was 15 years old , i went from being what i think was a strapping young athlete , over four months , slowly wasting away until i was basically a famine victim with an unquenchable thirst . i had basically digested away my body . and this all came to a head when i was on a backpacking trip , my first one ever actually , on old rag mountain in west virginia , and was putting my face into puddles of water and drinking like a dog . that night , i was taken into the emergency room and diagnosed as a type 1 diabetic in full - blown ketoacidosis . and i recovered , thanks to the miracles of modern medicine , insulin and other things , and gained all my weight back and more . and something festered inside me after this happened . what i thought about was , what caused the diabetes ? you see , diabetes is an autoimmune disease where your body fights itself , and at the time people thought that somehow maybe exposure to a pathogen had triggered my immune system to fight the pathogen and then kill the cells that make insulin . and this is what i thought for a long period of time , and that 's in fact what medicine and people have focused on quite a bit , the microbes that do bad things . and that 's where i need my assistant here now . you may recognize her . so , i went yesterday , i apologize , i skipped a few of the talks , and i went over to the national academy of sciences building , and they sell toys , giant microbes . and here we go ! so you have caught flesh - eating disease if you caught that one . i gotta get back out my baseball ability here . so , unfortunately or not surprisingly , most of the microbes they sell at the national academy building are pathogens . everybody focuses on the things that kill us , and that 's what i was focusing on . and it turns out that we are covered in a cloud of microbes , and those microbes actually do us good much of the time , rather than killing us . and so , we 've known about this for some period of time . people have used microscopes to look at the microbes that cover us , i know you 're not paying attention to me , but ... the microbes that cover us . and if you look at them in the microscope , you can see that we actually have 10 times as many cells of microbes on us as we have human cells . there 's more mass in the microbes than the mass of our brain . we are literally a teeming ecosystem of microorganisms . and unfortunately , if you want to learn about the microorganisms , just looking at them in a microscope is not sufficient . and so we just heard about the dna sequencing . it turns out that one of the best ways to look at microbes and to understand them is to look at their dna . and that 's what i 've been doing for 20 years , using dna sequencing , collecting samples from various places , including the human body , reading the dna sequence and then using that dna sequencing to tell us about the microbes that are in a particular place . and what 's amazing , when you use this technology , for example , looking at humans , we 're not just covered in a sea of microbes . there are thousands upon thousands of different kinds of microbes on us . we have millions of genes of microbes in our human microbiome covering us . and so this microbial diversity differs between people , and what people have been thinking about in the last 10 , maybe 15 years is , maybe these microbes , this microbial cloud in and on us , and the variation between us , may be responsible for some of the health and illness differences between us . and that comes back to the diabetes story i was telling you . it turns out that people now think that one of the triggers for type 1 diabetes is not fighting a pathogen , but is in fact trying to -- miscommunicating with the microbes that live in and on you . and somehow maybe the microbial community that 's in and on me got off , and then this triggered some sort of immune response and led to me killing the cells that make insulin in my body . and so what i want to tell you about for a few minutes is , what people have learned using dna sequencing techniques in particular , to study the microbial cloud that lives in and on us . and i want to tell you a story about a personal project . my first personal experience with studying the microbes on the human body actually came from a talk that i gave , right around the corner from here at georgetown . i gave a talk , and a family friend who happened to be the dean of georgetown medical school was at the talk , and came up to me afterwards saying , they were doing a study of ileal transplants in people . and they wanted to look at the microbes after the transplants . and so i started a collaboration with this person , michael zasloff and thomas fishbein , to look at the microbes that colonized these ilea after they were transplanted into a recipient . and i can tell you all the details about the microbial study that we did there , but the reason i want to tell you this story is something really striking that they did at the beginning of this project . they take the donor ileum , which is filled with microbes from a donor and they have a recipient who might have a problem with their microbial community , say crohn 's disease , and they sterilized the donor ileum . cleaned out all the microbes , and then put it in the recipient . they did this because this was common practice in medicine , even though it was obvious that this was not a good idea . and fortunately , in the course of this project , the transplant surgeons and the other people decided , forget common practice . we have to switch . so they actually switched to leaving some of the microbial community in the ileum . they leave the microbes with the donor , and theoretically that might help the people who are receiving this ileal transplant . and so , people -- this is a study that i did now . in the last few years there 's been a great expansion in using dna technology to study the microbes in and on people . there 's something called the human microbiome project that 's going on in the united states , and metahit going on in europe , and a lot of other projects . and when people have done a variety of studies , they have learned things such as , when a baby is born , during vaginal delivery you get colonized by the microbes from your mother . there are risk factors associated with cesarean sections , some of those risk factors may be due to mis - colonization when you carve a baby out of its mother rather than being delivered through the birth canal . and a variety of other studies have shown that the microbial community that lives in and on us helps in development of the immune system , helps in fighting off pathogens , helps in our metabolism , and determining our metabolic rate , probably determines our odor , and may even shape our behavior in a variety of ways . and so , these studies have documented or suggested out of a variety of important functions for the microbial community , this cloud , the non - pathogens that live in and on us . and one area that i think is very interesting , which many of you may have now that we 've thrown microbes into the crowd , is something that i would call " germophobia . " so people are really into cleanliness , right ? we have antibiotics in our kitchen counters , people are washing every part of them all of the time , we pump antibiotics into our food , into our communities , we take antibiotics excessively . and killing pathogens is a good thing if you 're sick , but we should understand that when we pump chemicals and antibiotics into our world , that we 're also killing the cloud of microbes that live in and on us . and excessive use of antibiotics , in particular in children , has been shown to be associated with , again , risk factors for obesity , for autoimmune diseases , for a variety of problems that are probably due to disruption of the microbial community . so the microbial community can go wrong whether we want it to or not , or we can kill it with antibiotics , but what can we do to restore it ? i 'm sure many people here have heard about probiotics . probiotics are one thing that you can try and do to restore the microbial community that is in and on you . and they definitely have been shown to be effective in some cases . there 's a project going on at uc davis where people are using probiotics to try and treat , prevent , necrotizing enterocolitis in premature infants . premature infants have real problems with their microbial community . and it may be that probiotics can help prevent the development of this horrible necrotizing enterocolitis in these premature infants . but probiotics are sort of a very , very simple solution . most of the pills that you can take or the yogurts that you can eat have one or two species in them , maybe five species in them , and the human community is thousands upon thousands of species . so what can we do to restore our microbial community when we have thousands and thousands of species on us ? well , one thing that animals seem to do is , they eat poo -- coprophagia . and it turns out that many veterinarians , old school veterinarians in particular , have been doing something called " poo tea , " not booty , but poo tea , to treat colic and other ailments in horses and cows and things like that , where you make tea from the poo from a healthy individual animal and you feed it to a sick animal . although , unless you have a fistulated cow with a big hole in its side , and you can put your hand into its rumen , it 's hard to imagine that the delivery of microbes directly into the mouth and through the entire top of the digestive tract is the best delivery system , so you may have heard in people they are now doing fecal transplants , where rather than delivering a couple of probiotic microbes through the mouth , they are delivering a community of probiotics , a community of microbes from a healthy donor , through the other end . and this has turned out to be very effective in fighting certain intransigent infectious diseases like clostridium difficile infections that can stay with people for years and years and years . transplants of the feces , of the microbes from the feces , from a healthy donor has actually been shown to cure systemic c. dif infections in some people . now what these transplants , these fecal transplants , or the poo tea suggest to me , and many other people have come up with this same idea , is that the microbial community in and on us , it 's an organ . we should view it as a functioning organ , part of ourselves . we should treat it carefully and with respect , and we do not want to mess with it , say by c - sections or by antibiotics or excessive cleanliness , without some real good justification . and what the dna sequencing technologies are allowing people to do now is do detailed studies of , say , 100 patients who have crohn 's disease and 100 people who do n't have crohn 's disease . or 100 people who took antibiotics when they were little , and 100 people who did not take antibiotics . and we can now start to compare the community of microbes and their genes and see if there are differences . and eventually we may be able to understand if they 're not just correlative differences , but causative . studies in model systems like mouse and other animals are also helping do this , but people are now using these technologies because they 've gotten very cheap , to study the microbes in and on a variety of people . so , in wrapping up , what i want to tell you about is , i did n't tell you a part of the story of coming down with diabetes . it turns out that my father was an m.d. , actually studied hormones . i told him many times that i was tired , thirsty , not feeling very good . and he shrugged it off , i think he either thought i was just complaining a lot , or it was the typical m.d. " nothing can be wrong with my children . " we even went to the international society of endocrinology meeting as family in quebec . and i was getting up every five minutes to pee , and drinking everybody 's water at the table , and i think they all thought i was a druggie . but the reason i 'm telling you this is that the medical community , my father as an example , sometimes does n't see what 's right in front of their eyes . the microbial cloud , it is right in front of us . we ca n't see it most of the time . it 's invisible . they 're microbes . they 're tiny . but we can see them through their dna , we can see them through the effects that they have on people . and what we need now is to start thinking about this microbial community in the context of everything in human medicine . it does n't mean that it affects every part of us , but it might . what we need is a full field guide to the microbes that live in and on people , so that we can understand what they 're doing to our lives . we are them . they are us . thank you .
global education	radical openness is still a distant future in the field of school education . we have such a hard time figuring out that learning is not a place but an activity . but i want to tell you the story of pisa , oecd 's test to measure the knowledge and skills of 15 - year - olds around the world , and it 's really a story of how international comparisons have globalized the field of education that we usually treat as an affair of domestic policy . look at how the world looked in the 1960s , in terms of the proportion of people who had completed high school . you can see the united states ahead of everyone else , and much of the economic success of the united states draws on its long - standing advantage as the first mover in education . but in the 1970s , some countries caught up . in the 1980s , the global expansion of the talent pool continued . and the world did n't stop in the 1990s . so in the '60s , the u.s. was first . in the '90s , it was 13th , and not because standards had fallen , but because they had risen so much faster elsewhere . korea shows you what 's possible in education . two generations ago , korea had the standard of living of afghanistan today , and was one of the lowest education performers . today , every young korean finishes high school . so this tells us that , in a global economy , it is no longer national improvement that 's the benchmark for success , but the best performing education systems internationally . the trouble is that measuring how much time people spend in school or what degree they have got is not always a good way of seeing what they can actually do . look at the toxic mix of unemployed graduates on our streets , while employers say they cannot find the people with the skills they need . and that tells you that better degrees do n't automatically translate into better skills and better jobs and better lives . so with pisa , we try to change this by measuring the knowledge and skills of people directly . and we took a very special angle to this . we were less interested in whether students can simply reproduce what they have learned in school , but we wanted to test whether they can extrapolate from what they know and apply their knowledge in novel situations . now , some people have criticized us for this . they say , you know , such a way of measuring outcomes is terribly unfair to people , because we test students with problems they have n't seen before . but if you take that logic , you know , you should consider life unfair , because the test of truth in life is not whether we can remember what we learned in school , but whether we are prepared for change , whether we are prepared for jobs that have n't been created , to use technologies that have n't been invented , to solve problems we just ca n't anticipate today . and once hotly contested , our way of measuring outcomes has actually quickly become the standard . in our latest assessment in 2009 , we measured 74 school systems that together cover 87 percent of the economy . this chart shows you the performance of countries . in red , sort of below oecd average . yellow is so - so , and in green are the countries doing really well . you can see shanghai , korea , singapore in asia ; finland in europe ; canada in north america doing really well . you can also see that there is a gap of almost three and a half school years between 15 - year - olds in shanghai and 15 - year - olds in chile , and the gap grows to seven school years when you include the countries with really poor performance . there 's a world of difference in the way in which young people are prepared for today 's economy . but i want to introduce a second important dimension into this picture . educators like to talk about equity . with pisa , we wanted to measure how they actually deliver equity , in terms of ensuring that people from different social backgrounds have equal chances . and we see that in some countries , the impact of social background on learning outcomes is very , very strong . opportunities are unequally distributed . a lot of potential of young children is wasted . we see in other countries that it matters much less into which social context you 're born . we all want to be there , in the upper right quadrant , where performance is strong and learning opportunities are equally distributed . nobody , and no country , can afford to be there , where performance is poor and there are large social disparities . and then we can debate , you know , is it better to be there , where performance is strong at the price of large disparities ? or do we want to focus on equity and accept mediocrity ? but actually , if you look at how countries come out on this picture , you see there are a lot of countries that actually are combining excellence with equity . in fact , one of the most important lessons from this comparison is that you do n't have to compromise equity to achieve excellence . these countries have moved on from providing excellence for just some to providing excellence for all , a very important lesson . and that also challenges the paradigms of many school systems that believe they are mainly there to sort people . and ever since those results came out , policymakers , educators , researchers from around the world have tried to figure out what 's behind the success of those systems . but let 's step back for a moment and focus on the countries that actually started pisa , and i 'm giving them a colored bubble now . and i 'm making the size of the bubble proportional to the amount of money that countries spent on students . if money would tell you everything about the quality of learning outcomes , you would find all the large bubbles at the top , no ? but that 's not what you see . spending per student only explains about , well , less than 20 percent of the performance variation among countries , and luxembourg , for example , the most expensive system , does n't do particularly well . what you see is that two countries with similar spending achieve very different results . you also see -- and i think that 's one of the most encouraging findings -- that we no longer live in a world that is neatly divided between rich and well - educated countries , and poor and badly - educated ones , a very , very important lesson . let 's look at this in greater detail . the red dot shows you spending per student relative to a country 's wealth . one way you can spend money is by paying teachers well , and you can see korea investing a lot in attracting the best people into the teaching profession . and korea also invests into long school days , which drives up costs further . last but not least , koreans want their teachers not only to teach but also to develop . they invest in professional development and collaboration and many other things . all that costs money . how can korea afford all of this ? the answer is , students in korea learn in large classes . this is the blue bar which is driving costs down . you go to the next country on the list , luxembourg , and you can see the red dot is exactly where it is for korea , so luxembourg spends the same per student as korea does . but , you know , parents and teachers and policymakers in luxembourg all like small classes . you know , it 's very pleasant to walk into a small class . so they have invested all their money into there , and the blue bar , class size , is driving costs up . but even luxembourg can spend its money only once , and the price for this is that teachers are not paid particularly well . students do n't have long hours of learning . and basically , teachers have little time to do anything else than teaching . so you can see two countries spent their money very differently , and actually how they spent their money matters a lot more than how much they invest in education . let 's go back to the year 2000 . remember , that was the year before the ipod was invented . this is how the world looked then in terms of pisa performance . the first thing you can see is that the bubbles were a lot smaller , no ? we spent a lot less on education , about 35 percent less on education . so you ask yourself , if education has become so much more expensive , has it become so much better ? and the bitter truth really is that , you know , not in many countries . but there are some countries which have seen impressive improvements . germany , my own country , in the year 2000 , featured in the lower quadrant , below average performance , large social disparities . and remember , germany , we used to be one of those countries that comes out very well when you just count people who have degrees . very disappointing results . people were stunned by the results . and for the very first time , the public debate in germany was dominated for months by education , not tax , not other kinds of issues , but education was the center of the public debate . and then policymakers began to respond to this . the federal government dramatically raised its investment in education . a lot was done to increase the life chances of students with an immigrant background or from social disadvantage . and what 's really interesting is that this was n't just about optimizing existing policies , but data transformed some of the beliefs and paradigms underlying german education . for example , traditionally , the education of the very young children was seen as the business of families , and you would have cases where women were seen as neglecting their family responsibilities when they sent their children to kindergarten . pisa has transformed that debate , and pushed early childhood education right at the center of public policy in germany . or traditionally , the german education divides children at the age of 10 , very young children , between those deemed to pursue careers of knowledge workers and those who would end up working for the knowledge workers , and that mainly along socioeconomic lines , and that paradigm is being challenged now too . a lot of change . and the good news is , nine years later , you can see improvements in quality and equity . people have taken up the challenge , done something about it . or take korea , at the other end of the spectrum . in the year 2000 , korea did already very well , but the koreans were concerned that only a small share of their students achieved the really high levels of excellence . they took up the challenge , and korea was able to double the proportion of students achieving excellence in one decade in the field of reading . well , if you only focus on your brightest students , you know what happens is disparities grow , and you can see this bubble moving slightly to the other direction , but still , an impressive improvement . a major overhaul of poland 's education helped to dramatically reduce between variability among schools , turn around many of the lowest - performing schools , and raise performance by over half a school year . and you can see other countries as well . portugal was able to consolidate its fragmented school system , raise quality and improve equity , and so did hungary . so what you can actually see , there 's been a lot of change . and even those people who complain and say that the relative standing of countries on something like pisa is just an artifact of culture , of economic factors , of social issues , of homogeneity of societies , and so on , these people must now concede that education improvement is possible . you know , poland has n't changed its culture . it did n't change its economy . it did n't change the compositions of its population . it did n't fire its teachers . it changed its education policies and practice . very impressive . and all that raises , of course , the question : what can we learn from those countries in the green quadrant who have achieved high levels of equity , high levels of performance , and raised outcomes ? and , of course , the question is , can what works in one context provide a model elsewhere ? of course , you ca n't copy and paste education systems wholesale , but these comparisons have identified a range of factors that high - performing systems share . everybody agrees that education is important . everybody says that . but the test of truth is , how do you weigh that priority against other priorities ? how do countries pay their teachers relative to other highly skilled workers ? would you want your child to become a teacher rather than a lawyer ? how do the media talk about schools and teachers ? those are the critical questions , and what we have learned from pisa is that , in high - performing education systems , the leaders have convinced their citizens to make choices that value education , their future , more than consumption today . and you know what 's interesting ? you wo n't believe it , but there are countries in which the most attractive place to be is not the shopping center but the school . those things really exist . but placing a high value on education is just part of the picture . the other part is the belief that all children are capable of success . you have some countries where students are segregated early in their ages . you know , students are divided up , reflecting the belief that only some children can achieve world - class standards . but usually that is linked to very strong social disparities . if you go to japan in asia , or finland in europe , parents and teachers in those countries expect every student to succeed , and you can see that actually mirrored in student behavior . when we asked students what counts for success in mathematics , students in north america would typically tell us , you know , it 's all about talent . if i 'm not born as a genius in math , i 'd better study something else . nine out of 10 japanese students say that it depends on my own investment , on my own effort , and that tells you a lot about the system that is around them . in the past , different students were taught in similar ways . high performers on pisa embrace diversity with differentiated pedagogical practices . they realize that ordinary students have extraordinary talents , and they personalize learning opportunities . high - performing systems also share clear and ambitious standards across the entire spectrum . every student knows what matters . every student knows what 's required to be successful . and nowhere does the quality of an education system exceed the quality of its teachers . high - performing systems are very careful in how they recruit and select their teachers and how they train them . they watch how they improve the performances of teachers in difficulties who are struggling , and how they structure teacher pay . they provide an environment also in which teachers work together to frame good practice . and they provide intelligent pathways for teachers to grow in their careers . in bureaucratic school systems , teachers are often left alone in classrooms with a lot of prescription on what they should be teaching . high - performing systems are very clear what good performance is . they set very ambitious standards , but then they enable their teachers to figure out , what do i need to teach to my students today ? the past was about delivered wisdom in education . now the challenge is to enable user - generated wisdom . high performers have moved on from professional or from administrative forms of accountability and control -- sort of , how do you check whether people do what they 're supposed to do in education -- to professional forms of work organization . they enable their teachers to make innovations in pedagogy . they provide them with the kind of development they need to develop stronger pedagogical practices . the goal of the past was standardization and compliance . high - performing systems have made teachers and school principals inventive . in the past , the policy focus was on outcomes , on provision . the high - performing systems have helped teachers and school principals to look outwards to the next teacher , the next school around their lives . and the most impressive outcomes of world - class systems is that they achieve high performance across the entire system . you 've seen finland doing so well on pisa , but what makes finland so impressive is that only five percent of the performance variation amongst students lies between schools . every school succeeds . this is where success is systemic . and how do they do that ? they invest resources where they can make the most difference . they attract the strongest principals into the toughest schools , and the most talented teachers into the most challenging classroom . last but not least , those countries align policies across all areas of public policy . they make them coherent over sustained periods of time , and they ensure that what they do is consistently implemented . now , knowing what successful systems are doing does n't yet tell us how to improve . that 's also clear , and that 's where some of the limits of international comparisons of pisa are . that 's where other forms of research need to kick in , and that 's also why pisa does n't venture into telling countries what they should be doing . but its strength lies in telling them what everybody else has been doing . and the example of pisa shows that data can be more powerful than administrative control of financial subsidy through which we usually run education systems . you know , some people argue that changing educational administration is like moving graveyards . you just ca n't rely on the people out there to help you with this . but pisa has shown what 's possible in education . it has helped countries to see that improvement is possible . it has taken away excuses from those who are complacent . and it has helped countries to set meaningful targets in terms of measurable goals achieved by the world 's leaders . if we can help every child , every teacher , every school , every principal , every parent see what improvement is possible , that only the sky is the limit to education improvement , we have laid the foundations for better policies and better lives . thank you .
science entertainment	i 'm a gamer , so i like to have goals . i like special missions and secret objectives . so here 's my special mission for this talk : i 'm going to try to increase the life span of every single person in this room by seven and a half minutes . literally , you will live seven and half minutes longer than you would have otherwise , just because you watched this talk . okay , some of you are looking a little bit skeptical . that 's okay , because check it out -- i have math to prove that it is possible . and it wo n't make a lot of sense now . i 'll explain it all later , just pay attention to the number at the bottom : plus - 7.68245837 minutes that will be my gift to you if i 'm successful in my mission . now , you have a secret mission too . your mission is to figure out how you want to spend your extra seven and a half minutes . and i think you should do something unusual with them , because these are bonus minutes . you were n't going to have them anyway . now , because i 'm a game designer , you might be thinking to yourself , i know what she wants us to do with those minutes , she wants us to spend them playing games . now this is a totally reasonable assumption , given that i have made quite a habit of encouraging people to spend more time playing games . for example , in my first tedtalk , i did propose that we should spend 21 billion hours a week as a planet playing video games . now , 21 billion hours , it 's a lot of time . it 's so much time , in fact , that the number one unsolicited comment that i have heard from people all over the world since i gave that talk , is this : jane , games are great and all , but on your deathbed , are you really going to wish you spent more time playing angry birds ? this idea is so pervasive -- that games are a waste of time that we will come to regret -- that i hear it literally everywhere i go . for example , true story : just a few weeks ago , this cab driver , upon finding out that a friend and i were in town for a game developer 's conference , turned around and said -- and i quote -- " i hate games . waste of life . imagine getting to the end of your life and regretting all that time . " now , i want to take this problem seriously . i mean , i want games to be a force for good in the world . i do n't want gamers to regret the time they spent playing , time that i encouraged them to spend . so i have been thinking about this question a lot lately . when we 're on our deathbeds , will we regret the time we spent playing games ? now , this may surprise you , but it turns out there is actually some scientific research on this question . it 's true . hospice workers , the people who take care of us at the end of our lives , recently issued a report on the most frequently expressed regrets that people say when they are literally on their deathbeds . and that 's what i want to share with you today -- the top five regrets of the dying . number one : i wish i had n't worked so hard . number two : i wish i had stayed in touch with my friends . number three : i wish i had let myself be happier . number four : i wish i 'd had the courage to express my true self . and number five : i wish i 'd lived a life true to my dreams , instead of what others expected of me . now , as far as i know , no one ever told one of the hospice workers , i wish i 'd spent more time playing video games , but when i hear these top five regrets of the dying , i ca n't help but hear five deep human cravings that games actually help us fulfill . for example , i wish i had n't worked so hard . for many people , this means , i wish i 'd spent more time with my family , with my kids when they were growing up . well , we know that playing games together has tremendous family benefits . a recent study from brigham young university school of family life reported that parents who spend more time playing video games with their kids have much stronger real - life relationships with them . i wish i 'd stayed in touch with my friends . well , hundreds of millions of people use social games like farmville or words with friends to stay in daily contact with real - life friends and family . a recent study from [ university of michigan ] showed that these games are incredibly powerful relationship - management tools . they help us stay connected with people in our social network that we would otherwise grow distant from , if we were n't playing games together . i wish i 'd let myself be happier . well , here i ca n't help but think of the groundbreaking clinical trials recently conducted at east carolina university that showed that online games can outperform pharmaceuticals for treating clinical anxiety and depression . just 30 minutes of online game play a day was enough to create dramatic boosts in mood and long - term increases in happiness . i wish i 'd had the courage to express my true self . well , avatars are a way to express our true selves , our most heroic , idealized version of who we might become . you can see that in this alter ego portrait by robbie cooper of a gamer with his avatar . and stanford university has been doing research for five years now to document how playing a game with an idealized avatar changes how we think and act in real life , making us more courageous , more ambitious , more committed to our goals . i wish i 'd led a life true to my dreams , and not what others expected of me . are games doing this yet ? i 'm not sure , so i 've left a question mark , a super mario question mark . and we 're going to come back to this one . but in the mean time , perhaps you 're wondering , who is this game designer to be talking to us about deathbed regrets ? and it 's true , i 've never worked in a hospice , i 've never been on my deathbed . but recently i did spend three months in bed , wanting to die . really wanting to die . now let me tell you that story . it started two years ago , when i hit my head and got a concussion . now the concussion did n't heal properly , and after 30 days i was left with symptoms like nonstop headaches , nausea , vertigo , memory loss , mental fog . my doctor told me that in order to heal my brain , i had to rest it . so i had to avoid everything that triggered my symptoms . for me that meant no reading , no writing , no video games , no work or email , no running , no alcohol , no caffeine . in other words -- and i think you see where this is going -- no reason to live . of course it 's meant to be funny , but in all seriousness , suicidal ideation is quite common with traumatic brain injuries . it happens to one in three , and it happened to me . my brain started telling me , jane , you want to die . it said , you 're never going to get better . it said , the pain will never end . and these voices became so persistent and so persuasive that i started to legitimately fear for my life , which is the time that i said to myself after 34 days -- and i will never forget this moment -- i said , i am either going to kill myself or i 'm going to turn this into a game . now , why a game ? i knew from researching the psychology of games for more than a decade that when we play a game -- and this is in the scientific literature -- we tackle tough challenges with more creativity , more determination , more optimism , and we 're more likely to reach out to others for help . and i wanted to bring these gamer traits to my real - life challenge , so i created a role - playing recovery game called jane the concussion slayer . now this became my new secret identity , and the first thing i did as a slayer was call my twin sister -- i have an identical twin sister named kelly -- and tell her , i 'm playing a game to heal my brain , and i want you to play with me . this was an easier way to ask for help . she became my first ally in the game , my husband kiyash joined next , and together we identified and battled the bad guys . now this was anything that could trigger my symptoms and therefore slow down the healing process , things like bright lights and crowded spaces . we also collected and activated power - ups . this was anything i could do on even my worst day to feel just a little bit good , just a little bit productive . things like cuddling my dog for 10 minutes , or getting out of bed and walking around the block just once . now the game was that simple : adopt a secret identity , recruit your allies , battle the bad guys , activate the power - ups . but even with a game so simple , within just a couple days of starting to play , that fog of depression and anxiety went away . it just vanished . it felt like a miracle . now it was n't a miracle cure for the headaches or the cognitive symptoms . that lasted for more than a year , and it was the hardest year of my life by far . but even when i still had the symptoms , even while i was still in pain , i stopped suffering . now what happened next with the game surprised me . i put up some blog posts and videos online , explaining how to play . but not everybody has a concussion , obviously , not everyone wants to be " the slayer , " so i renamed the game superbetter . and soon i started hearing from people all over the world who were adopting their own secret identity , recruiting their own allies , and they were getting " super better " facing challenges like cancer and chronic pain , depression and crohn 's disease . even people were playing it for terminal diagnoses like als . and i could tell from their messages and their videos that the game was helping them in the same ways that it helped me . they talked about feeling stronger and braver . they talked about feeling better understood by their friends and family . and they even talked about feeling happier , even though they were in pain , even though they were tackling the toughest challenge of their lives . now at the time , i 'm thinking to myself , what is going on here ? i mean , how could a game so trivial intervene so powerfully in such serious , and in some cases life - and - death , circumstances ? i mean , if it had n't worked for me , there 's no way i would have believed it was possible . well , it turns out there 's some science here too . some people get stronger and happier after a traumatic event . and that 's what was happening to us . the game was helping us experience what scientists call post - traumatic growth , which is not something we usually hear about . we usually hear about post - traumatic stress disorder . but scientists now know that a traumatic event does n't doom us to suffer indefinitely . instead , we can use it as a springboard to unleash our best qualities and lead happier lives . here are the top five things that people with post - traumatic growth say : my priorities have changed . i 'm not afraid to do what makes me happy . i feel closer to my friends and family . i understand myself better . i know who i really am now . i have a new sense of meaning and purpose in my life . i 'm better able to focus on my goals and dreams . now , does this sound familiar ? it should , because the top five traits of post - traumatic growth are essentially the direct opposite of the top five regrets of the dying . now this is interesting , right ? it seems that somehow , a traumatic event can unlock our ability to lead a life with fewer regrets . but how does it work ? how do you get from trauma to growth ? or better yet , is there a way to get all the benefits of post - traumatic growth without the trauma , without having to hit your head in the first place ? that would be good , right ? i wanted to understand the phenomenon better , so i devoured the scientific literature , and here 's what i learned . there are four kinds of strength , or resilience , that contribute to post - traumatic growth , and there are scientifically validated activities that you can do every day to build up these four kinds of resilience , and you do n't need a trauma to do it . now , i could tell you what these four types of strength are , but i 'd rather you experience them firsthand . i 'd rather we all start building them up together right now . so here 's what we 're going to do . we 're going to play a quick game together . this is where you earn those seven and a half minutes of bonus life that i promised you earlier . all you have to do is successfully complete the first four superbetter quests . and i feel like you can do it . i have confidence in you . so , everybody ready ? this is your first quest . here we go . pick one : stand up and take three steps , or make your hands into fists , raise them over your head as high as you can for five seconds . go ! all right , i like the people doing both . you are overachievers . very good . well done , everyone . now that is worth plus - one physical resilience , which means that your body can withstand more stress and heal itself faster . now we know from the research that the number one thing you can do to boost your physical resilience is to not sit still . that 's all it takes . every single second that you are not sitting still , you are actively improving the health of your heart , and your lungs and brains . everybody ready for your next quest ? i want you to snap your fingers exactly 50 times , or count backwards from 100 by seven , like this : 100 , 93 ... go ! do n't give up . do n't let the people counting down from 100 interfere with your counting to 50 . nice . wow . that 's the first time i 've ever seen that . bonus physical resilience . well done , everyone . now that 's worth plus - one mental resilience , which means you have more mental focus , more discipline , determination and willpower . we know from the scientific research that willpower actually works like a muscle . it gets stronger the more you exercise it . so tackling a tiny challenge without giving up , even one as absurd as snapping your fingers exactly 50 times or counting backwards from 100 by seven is actually a scientifically validated way to boost your willpower . so good job . quest number three . pick one : now because of the room we 're in , fate 's really determined this for you , but here are the two options . if you 're inside , find a window and look out of it . if you 're outside , find a window and look in . or do a quick youtube or google image search for " baby [ your favorite animal . ] " now , you could do this on your phones , or you could just shout out some baby animals , i 'm going to find some and put them on the screen for us . so , what do we want to see ? sloth , giraffe , elephant , snake . okay , let 's see what we got . baby dolphin and baby llamas . everybody look . got that ? okay , one more . baby elephant . we 're clapping for that ? that 's amazing . all right , now what we 're just feeling there is plus - one emotional resilience , which means you have the ability to provoke powerful , positive emotions like curiosity or love , which we feel when we look at baby animals , when you need them most . and here 's a secret from the scientific literature for you . if you can manage to experience three positive emotions for every one negative emotion over the course of an hour , a day , a week , you dramatically improve your health and your ability to successfully tackle any problem you 're facing . and this is called the three - to - one positive emotion ratio . it 's my favorite superbetter trick , so keep it up . all right , pick one , last quest : shake someone 's hand for six seconds , or send someone a quick thank you by text , email , facebook or twitter . go ! looking good , looking good . nice , nice . keep it up . i love it ! all right , everybody , that is plus - one social resilience , which means you actually get more strength from your friends , your neighbors , your family , your community . now , a great way to boost social resilience is gratitude . touch is even better . here 's one more secret for you : shaking someone 's hand for six seconds dramatically raises the level of oxytocin in your bloodstream , now that 's the trust hormone . that means that all of you who just shook hands are biochemically primed to like and want to help each other . this will linger during the break , so take advantage of the networking opportunities . okay , well you have successfully completed your four quests , so let 's see if i 've successfully completed my mission to give you seven and a half minutes of bonus life . and here 's where i get to share one more little bit of science with you . it turns out that people who regularly boost these four types of resilience -- physical , mental , emotional and social -- live 10 years longer than everyone else . so this is true . if you are regularly achieving the three - to - one positive emotion ratio , if you are never sitting still for more than an hour at a time , if you are reaching out to one person you care about every single day , if you are tackling tiny goals to boost your willpower , you will live 10 years longer than everyone else , and here 's where that math i showed you earlier comes in . so , the average life expectancy in the u.s. and the u.k. is 78.1 years , but we know from more than 1,000 peer - reviewed scientific studies that you can add 10 years of life to that by boosting your four types of resilience . so every single year that you are boosting your four types of resilience , you 're actually earning .128 more years of life or 46 more days of life , or 67,298 more minutes of life , which means every single day , you are earning 184 minutes of life , or every single hour that you are boosting your four types of resilience , like we just did together , you are earning 7.68245837 more minutes of life . congratulations , those seven and a half minutes are all yours . you totally earned them . yeah ! awesome . wait , wait , wait . you still have your special mission , your secret mission . how are you going to spend these seven and a half minutes of bonus life ? well , here 's my suggestion . these seven and a half bonus minutes are kind of like genie 's wishes . you can use your first wish to wish for a million more wishes . pretty clever , right ? so , if you spend these seven and a half minutes today doing something that makes you happy , or that gets you physically active , or puts you in touch with someone you care about , or even just tackling a tiny challenge , you are going to boost your resilience , so you 're going to earn more minutes . and the good news is , you can keep going like that . every hour of the day , every day of your life , all the way to your deathbed , which will now be 10 years later than it would have otherwise . and when you get there , more than likely , you will not have any of those top five regrets , because you will have built up the strength and resilience to lead a life truer to your dreams . and with 10 extra years , you might even have enough time to play a few more games . thank you .
culture	this story starts : i was at a friend 's house , and she had on her shelf a copy of the dsm manual , which is the manual of mental disorders . it lists every known mental disorder . and it used to be , back in the '50s , a very slim pamphlet . and then it got bigger and bigger and bigger , and now it 's 886 pages long . and it lists currently 374 mental disorders . so i was leafing through it , wondering if i had any mental disorders , and it turns out i 've got 12 . i 've got generalized anxiety disorder , which is a given . i 've got nightmare disorder , which is categorized if you have recurrent dreams of being pursued or declared a failure -- and all my dreams involve people chasing me down the street going , " you 're a failure . " i 've got parent - child relational problems , which i blame my parents for . i 'm kidding . i 'm not kidding . i 'm kidding . and i 've got malingering . and i think it 's actually quite rare to have both malingering and generalized anxiety disorder , because malingering tends to make me feel very anxious . anyway i was looking through this book , wondering if i was much crazier than i thought i was , or maybe it 's not a good idea to diagnose yourself with a mental disorder if you 're not a trained professional , or maybe the psychiatry profession has a strange desire to label what 's essentially normal human behavior as a mental disorder . i did n't know which of these things was true , but i thought it was kind of interesting . and i thought maybe i should meet a critic of psychiatry to get their view . which is how i ended up having lunch with the scientologists . it was a man called brian who runs a crack team of scientologists who are determined to destroy psychiatry wherever it lies . they 're called the cchr . and i said to him , " can you prove to me that psychiatry is a pseudo - science that ca n't be trusted ? " and he said , " yes , we can prove it to you . " and i said , " how ? " and he said , " we 're going to introduce you to tony . " and i said , " who 's tony ? " and he said , " tony 's in broadmoor . " now broadmoor is broadmoor hospital . it used to be known as the broadmoor asylum for the criminally insane . it 's where they send the serial killers and the people who ca n't help themselves . and i said to brian , " what did tony do ? " and he said , " hardly anything . he beat someone up or something , and he decided to fake madness to get out of a prison sentence . but he faked it too well , and now he 's stuck in broadmoor and nobody will believe he 's sane . do you want us to try and get you into broadmoor to meet tony ? " so i said , " yes , please . " so i got the train to broadmoor . i began to yawn uncontrollably around kempton park , which apparently is what dogs also do when anxious -- they yawn uncontrollably . and we got to broadmoor . and i got taken through gate after gate after gate after gate into the wellness center , which is where you get to meet the patients . it looks like a giant hampton inn . it 's all peach and pine and calming colors . and the only bold colors are the reds of the panic buttons . and the patients started drifting in . and they were quite overweight and wearing sweatpants and quite docile looking . and brian the scientologist whispered to me , " they 're medicated , " which to the scientologists is like the worst evil in the world , but i 'm thinking it 's probably a good idea . and then brian said , " here 's tony . " and a man was walking in . and he was n't overweight , he was in very good physical shape . and he was n't wearing sweatpants , he was wearing a pinstriped suit . and he had his arm outstretched like someone out of the apprentice . he looked like a man who wanted to wear an outfit that would convince me that he was very sane . and he sat down . and i said , " so is it true that you faked your way in here ? " and he said , " yep . yep . absolutely . i beat someone up when i was 17 . and i was in prison awaiting trial , and my cellmate said to me , ' you know what you have to do ? fake madness . tell them you 're mad . you 'll get sent to some cushy hospital . nurses will bring you pizzas . you 'll have your own playstation . ' " so i said , " well how did you do it ? " he said , " i asked to see the prison psychiatrist . and i 'd just seen a film called ' crash ' in which people get sexual pleasure from crashing cars into walls . so i said to the psychiatrist , ' i get sexual pleasure from crashing cars into walls . ' " and i said , " what else ? " he said , " oh , yeah . i told the psychiatrist that i wanted to watch women as they died because it would make me feel more normal . " and i said , " where 'd you get that from ? " he said , " oh , from a biography of ted bundy that they had at the prison library . " anyway he faked madness too well , he said . and they did n't send him to some cushy hospital . they sent him to broadmoor . and the minute he got there , he said he took one look at the place , asked to see the psychiatrist , said , " there 's been a terrible misunderstanding . i 'm not mentally ill. " i said , " how long have you been here for ? " he said , " well , if i 'd just done my time in prison for the original crime , i 'd have got five years . i 've been in broadmoor for 12 years . " tony said that it 's a lot harder to convince people you 're sane than it is to convince them you 're crazy . he said , " i thought the best way to seem normal would be to talk to people normally about normal things like football or what 's on tv . i subscribe to new scientist , and recently it had an article about how the u.s. army was training bumblebees to sniff out explosives . so i said to a nurse , ' did you know that the u.s. army is training bumblebees to sniff out explosives ? ' when i read my medical notes , i saw they 'd written : ' believes bees can sniff out explosives . ' " he said , " you know , they 're always looking out for non - verbal clues to my mental state . but how do you sit in a sane way ? how do you cross your legs in a sane way ? it 's just impossible . " and when tony said that to me , i thought to myself , " am i sitting like a journalist ? am i crossing my legs like a journalist ? " he said , " you know , i 've got the stockwell strangler on one side of me and i 've got the ' tiptoe through the tulips ' rapist on the other side of me . so i tend to stay in my room a lot because i find them quite frightening . and they take that as a sign of madness . they say it proves that i 'm aloof and grandiose . " so only in broadmoor would not wanting to hang out with serial killers be a sign of madness . anyway he seemed completely normal to me -- but what did i know ? and when i got home i emailed his clinician , anthony maden . i said , " what 's the story ? " and he said , " yep . we accept that tony faked madness to get out of a prison sentence because his hallucinations that had seemed quite cliché to begin with just vanished the minute he got to broadmoor . however , we have assessed him . and we have determined that what he is is a psychopath . " and in fact , faking madness is exactly the kind of cunning and manipulative act of a psychopath . it 's on the checklist : cunning and manipulative . so faking your brain going wrong is evidence that your brain has gone wrong . and i spoke to other experts , and they said the pinstriped suit -- classic psychopath . speaks to items one and two on the checklist -- glibness , superficial charm and grandiose sense of self - worth . and i said , " well , what , he did n't want to hang out with the other patients ? " classic psychopath -- it speaks to grandiosity and also lack of empathy . so all the things that had seemed most normal about tony was evidence , according to his clinician , that he was mad in this new way . he was a psychopath . and his clinician said to me , " if you want to know more about psychopaths , you can go on a psychopath spotting course run by robert hare who invented the psychopath checklist . " so i did . i went on a psychopath spotting course , and i am now a certified -- and i have to say , extremely adept -- psychopath spotter . so here 's the statistics : one in a hundred regular people is a psychopath . so there 's 1,500 people in his room . fifteen of you are psychopaths . although that figure rises to four percent of ceo 's and business leaders . so i think there 's a very good chance there 's about 30 or 40 psychopaths in this room . it could be carnage by the end of the night . hare said the reason why is because capitalism at its most ruthless rewards psychopathic behavior -- the lack of empathy , the glibness , cunning , manipulative . in fact , capitalism , perhaps at its most remorseless , is a physical manifestation of psychopathy . it 's like a form of psychopathy that 's come down to affect us all . and hare said to me , " you know what ? forget about some guy at broadmoor who may or may not have faked madness . who cares ? that 's not a big story . the big story , " he said , " is corporate psychopathy . you want to go and interview yourself some corporate psychopaths . " so i gave it a try . i wrote to the enron people . i said , " could i come and interview you in prison to find out it you 're psychopaths ? " and they did n't reply . so i changed tack . i emailed " chainsaw al " dunlap , the asset stripper from the 1990s . he would come into failing businesses and close down 30 percent of the workforce , just turn american towns into ghost towns . and i emailed him and i said , " i believe you may have a very special brain anomaly that makes you special and interested in the predatory spirit and fearless . can i come and interview you about your special brain anomaly ? " and he said , " come on over . " so i went to al dunlap 's grand florida mansion that was filled with sculptures of predatory animals . there were lions and tigers . he was taking me through the garden . there were falcons and eagles . he was saying to me , " over there you 've got sharks . " he was saying this in a less effeminate way . " you 've got more sharks and you 've got tigers . " it was like narnia . and then we went into his kitchen . now al dunlap would be brought in to save failing companies . he 'd close down 30 percent of the workforce . and he 'd quite often fire people with a joke . for instance , one famous story about him , somebody came up to him and said , " i 've just bought myself a new car . " and he said , " you may have a new car , but i 'll tell you what you do n't have , a job . " so in his kitchen -- he was standing there with his wife , judy , and his bodyguard sean -- and i said , " you know how i said in my email that you might have a special brain anomaly that makes you special ? " he said , " yeah , it 's an amazing theory . it 's like star trek . you 're going where no man has gone before . " and i said , " well , some psychologists might say that this makes you ... " and he said , " what ? " and i said , " a psychopath . " and i said , " i 've got a list of psychopathic traits in my pocket . can i go through them with you ? " and he looked intrigued despite himself , and he said , " okay , go on . " and i said , " okay . grandiose sense of self - worth . " which , i have to say , would have been hard for him to deny because he was standing underneath a giant oil painting of himself . he said , " well , you 've got to believe in you ! " and i said , " manipulative . " he said , " that 's leadership . " and i said , " shallow affect : an inability to experience a range of emotions . " he said , " who wants to be weighed down by some nonsense emotions ? " so he was going down the psychopathic checklist , basically turning it into " who moved my cheese ? " but i did notice something happening to me the day i was with al dunlap . whenever he said anything to me that was kind of normal -- like he said no to juvenile delinquency . he said he got accepted into west point , and they do n't let delinquents in west point . he said no to many short - term marital relationships . he 's only ever been married twice . admittedly , his first wife cited in her divorce papers that he once threatened her with a knife and said he always wondered what human flesh tasted like , but people say stupid things to each other in bad marriages in the heat of an argument and his second marriage has lasted 41 years . so whenever he said anything to me that just seemed kind of non - psychopathic , i thought to myself , well i 'm not going to put that in my book . and then i realized that becoming a psychopath spotter had turned me a little bit psychopathic . because i was desperate to shove him in a box marked psychopath . i was desperate to define him by his maddest edges . and i realized , oh my god . this is what i 've been doing for 20 years . it 's what all journalists do . we travel across the world with our notepads in our hands , and we wait for the gems . and the gems are always the outermost aspects of our interviewee 's personality . and we stitch them together like medieval monks . and we leave the normal stuff on the floor . and this is a country that over - diagnoses certain mental disorders hugely . childhood bipolar -- children as young as four are being labeled bipolar because they have temper tantrums , which scores them high on their bipolar checklist . when i got back to london , tony phoned me . he said , " why have n't you been returning my calls ? " i said , " well they say that you 're a psychopath . " and he said , " i 'm not a psychopath . " he said , " you know what , one of the items on the checklist is lack of remorse , but another item on the checklist is cunning , manipulative . so when you say you feel remorse for your crime , they say , ' typical of the psychopath to cunningly say he feels remorse when he does n't . ' it 's like witchcraft . they turn everything upside - down . " he said , " i 've got a tribunal coming up . will you come to it ? " so i said okay . so i went to his tribunal . and after 14 years in broadmoor , they let him go . they decided that he should n't be held indefinitely because he scores high on a checklist that might mean that he would have a greater than average chance of recidivism . so they let him go . and outside in the corridor he said to me , " you know what , jon ? everyone 's a bit psychopathic . " he said , " you are . i am. well obviously i am. " i said , " what are you going to do now ? " he said , " i 'm going to go to belgium because there 's a woman there that i fancy . but she 's married , so i 'm going to have to get her split up from her husband . " anyway , that was two years ago , and that 's where my book ended . and for the last 20 months everything was fine . nothing bad happened . he was living with a girl outside london . he was , according to brian the scientologist , making up for lost time -- which i know sounds ominous , but is n't necessarily ominous . unfortunately , after 20 months , he did go back to jail for a month . he got into a fracas in a bar , he called it -- ended up going to jail for a month , which i know is bad , but at least a month implies that whatever the fracas was , it was n't too bad . and then he phoned me . and you know what , i think it 's right that tony is out . because you should n't define people by their maddest edges . and what tony is , is he 's a semi - psychopath . he 's a gray area in a world that does n't like gray areas . but the gray areas are where you find the complexity , it 's where you find the humanity and it 's where you find the truth . and tony said to me , " jon , could i buy you a drink in a bar ? i just want to thank you for everything you 've done for me . " and i did n't go . what would you have done ? thank you .
culture global business	i want to talk about social innovation and social entrepreneurship . i happen to have triplets . they 're little . they 're five years old . sometimes i tell people i have triplets . they say , " really ? how many ? " here 's a picture of the kids . that 's sage and annalisa and rider . now , i also happen to be gay . being gay and fathering triplets is by far the most socially innovative , socially entrepreneurial thing i have ever done . the real social innovation i want to talk about involves charity . i want to talk about how the things we 've been taught to think about giving and about charity and about the nonprofit sector are actually undermining the causes we love and our profound yearning to change the world . but before i do that , i want to ask if we even believe that the nonprofit sector has any serious role to play in changing the world . a lot of people say now that business will lift up the developing economies , and social business will take care of the rest . and i do believe that business will move the great mass of humanity forward . but it always leaves behind that 10 percent or more that is most disadvantaged or unlucky . and social business needs markets , and there are some issues for which you just ca n't develop the kind of money measures that you need for a market . i sit on the board of a center for the developmentally disabled , and these people want laughter and compassion and they want love . how do you monetize that ? and that 's where the nonprofit sector and philanthropy come in . philanthropy is the market for love . it is the market for all those people for whom there is no other market coming . and so if we really want , like buckminster fuller said , a world that works for everyone , with no one and nothing left out , then the nonprofit sector has to be a serious part of the conversation . but it does n't seem to be working . why have our breast cancer charities not come close to finding a cure for breast cancer , or our homeless charities not come close to ending homelessness in any major city ? why has poverty remained stuck at 12 percent of the u.s. population for 40 years ? and the answer is , these social problems are massive in scale , our organizations are tiny up against them , and we have a belief system that keeps them tiny . we have two rulebooks . we have one for the nonprofit sector and one for the rest of the economic world . it 's an apartheid , and it discriminates against the [ nonprofit ] sector in five different areas , the first being compensation . so in the for - profit sector , the more value you produce , the more money you can make . but we do n't like nonprofits to use money to incentivize people to produce more in social service . we have a visceral reaction to the idea that anyone would make very much money helping other people . interesting that we do n't have a visceral reaction to the notion that people would make a lot of money not helping other people . you know , you want to make 50 million dollars selling violent video games to kids , go for it . we 'll put you on the cover of wired magazine . but you want to make half a million dollars trying to cure kids of malaria , and you 're considered a parasite yourself . and we think of this as our system of ethics , but what we do n't realize is that this system has a powerful side effect , which is , it gives a really stark , mutually exclusive choice between doing very well for yourself and your family or doing good for the world to the brightest minds coming out of our best universities , and sends tens of thousands of people who could make a huge difference in the nonprofit sector marching every year directly into the for - profit sector because they 're not willing to make that kind of lifelong economic sacrifice . businessweek did a survey , looked at the compensation packages for mbas 10 years of business school , and the median compensation for a stanford mba , with bonus , at the age of 38 , was 400,000 dollars . meanwhile , for the same year , the average salary for the ceo of a $ 5 million - plus medical charity in the u.s. was 232,000 dollars , and for a hunger charity , 84,000 dollars . now , there 's no way you 're going to get a lot of people with $ 400,000 talent to make a $ 316,000 sacrifice every year to become the ceo of a hunger charity . some people say , " well , that 's just because those mba types are greedy . " not necessarily . they might be smart . it 's cheaper for that person to donate 100,000 dollars every year to the hunger charity , save 50,000 dollars on their taxes , so still be roughly 270,000 dollars a year ahead of the game , now be called a philanthropist because they donated 100,000 dollars to charity , probably sit on the board of the hunger charity , indeed , probably supervise the poor sob who decided to become the ceo of the hunger charity , and have a lifetime of this kind of power and influence and popular praise still ahead of them . the second area of discrimination is advertising and marketing . so we tell the for - profit sector , " spend , spend , spend on advertising until the last dollar no longer produces a penny of value . " but we do n't like to see our donations spent on advertising in charity . our attitude is , " well , look , if you can get the advertising donated , you know , at four o'clock in the morning , i 'm okay with that . but i do n't want my donations spent on advertising . i want it go to the needy . " as if the money invested in advertising could not bring in dramatically greater sums of money to serve the needy . in the 1990s , my company created the long distance aidsride bicycle journeys and the 60 - mile - long breast cancer three - day walks , and over the course of nine years , we had 182,000 ordinary heroes participate , and they raised a total of 581 million dollars . they raised more money more quickly for these causes than any events in history , all based on the idea that people are weary of being asked to do the least they can possibly do . people are yearning to measure the full distance of their potential on behalf of the causes that they care about deeply . but they have to be asked . we got that many people to participate by buying full - page ads in the new york times , in the boston globe , in primetime radio and tv advertising . do you know how many people we would have gotten if we put up flyers in the laundromat ? charitable giving has remained stuck , in the u.s. , at two percent of gdp ever since we started measuring it in the 1970s . that 's an important fact , because it tells us that in 40 years , the nonprofit sector has not been able to wrestle any market share away from the for - profit sector . and if you think about it , how could one sector possibly take market share away from another sector if it is n't really allowed to market ? and if we tell the consumer brands , " you may advertise all the benefits of your product , " but we tell charities , " you cannot advertise all the good that you do , " where do we think the consumer dollars are going to flow ? the third area of discrimination is the taking of risk in pursuit of new ideas for generating revenue . so disney can make a new $ 200 million movie that flops , and nobody calls the attorney general . but you do a little $ 1 million community fundraiser for the poor , and it does n't produce a 75 percent profit to the cause in the first 12 months , and your character is called into question . so nonprofits are really reluctant to attempt any brave , daring , giant - scale new fundraising endeavors for fear that if the thing fails , their reputations will be dragged through the mud . well , you and i know when you prohibit failure , you kill innovation . if you kill innovation in fundraising , you ca n't raise more revenue . if you ca n't raise more revenue , you ca n't grow . and if you ca n't grow , you ca n't possibly solve large social problems . the fourth area is time . so amazon went for six years without returning any profit to investors , and people had patience . they knew that there was a long - term objective down the line of building market dominance . but if a nonprofit organization ever had a dream of building magnificent scale that required that for six years , no money was going to go to the needy , it was all going to be invested in building this scale , we would expect a crucifixion . and the last area is profit itself . so the for - profit sector can pay people profits in order to attract their capital for their new ideas , but you ca n't pay profits in a nonprofit sector , so the for - profit sector has a lock on the multi - trillion - dollar capital markets , and the nonprofit sector is starved for growth and risk and idea capital . well , you put those five things together -- you ca n't use money to lure talent away from the for - profit sector , you ca n't advertise on anywhere near the scale the for - profit sector does for new customers , you ca n't take the kinds of risks in pursuit of those customers that the for - profit sector takes , you do n't have the same amount of time to find them as the for - profit sector , and you do n't have a stock market with which to fund any of this , even if you could do it in the first place , and you 've just put the nonprofit sector at an extreme disadvantage to the for - profit sector on every level . if we have any doubts about the effects of this separate rule book , this statistic is sobering : from 1970 to 2009 , the number of nonprofits that really grew , that crossed the $ 50 million annual revenue barrier , is 144 . in the same time , the number of for - profits that crossed it is 46,136 . so we 're dealing with social problems that are massive in scale , and our organizations ca n't generate any scale . all of the scale goes to coca - cola and burger king . so why do we think this way ? well , like most fanatical dogma in america , these ideas come from old puritan beliefs . the puritans came here for religious reasons , or so they said , but they also came here because they wanted to make a lot of money . they were pious people but they were also really aggressive capitalists , and they were accused of extreme forms of profit - making tendencies compared to the other colonists . but at the same time , the puritans were calvinists , so they were taught literally to hate themselves . they were taught that self - interest was a raging sea that was a sure path to eternal damnation . well , this created a real problem for these people , right ? here they 've come all the way across the atlantic to make all this money . making all this money will get you sent directly to hell . what were they to do about this ? well , charity became their answer . it became this economic sanctuary where they could do penance for their profit - making tendencies at five cents on the dollar . so of course , how could you make money in charity if charity was your penance for making money ? financial incentive was exiled from the realm of helping others so that it could thrive in the area of making money for yourself , and in 400 years , nothing has intervened to say , " that 's counterproductive and that 's unfair . " now this ideology gets policed by this one very dangerous question , which is , " what percentage of my donation goes to the cause versus overhead ? " there are a lot of problems with this question . i 'm going to just focus on two . first , it makes us think that overhead is a negative , that it is somehow not part of the cause . but it absolutely is , especially if it 's being used for growth . now , this idea that overhead is somehow an enemy of the cause creates this second , much larger problem , which is , it forces organizations to go without the overhead things they really need to grow in the interest of keeping overhead low . so we 've all been taught that charities should spend as little as possible on overhead things like fundraising under the theory that , well , the less money you spend on fundraising , the more money there is available for the cause . well , that 's true if it 's a depressing world in which this pie cannot be made any bigger . but if it 's a logical world in which investment in fundraising actually raises more funds and makes the pie bigger , then we have it precisely backwards , and we should be investing more money , not less , in fundraising , because fundraising is the one thing that has the potential to multiply the amount of money available for the cause that we care about so deeply . i 'll give you two examples . we launched the aidsrides with an initial investment of 50,000 dollars in risk capital . within nine years , we had multiplied that 1,982 times into 108 million dollars after all expenses for aids services . we launched the breast cancer three - days with an initial investment of 350,000 dollars in risk capital . within just five years , we had multiplied that 554 times into 194 million dollars after all expenses for breast cancer research . now , if you were a philanthropist really interested in breast cancer , what would make more sense : go out and find the most innovative researcher in the world and give her 350,000 dollars for research , or give her fundraising department the 350,000 dollars to multiply it into 194 million dollars for breast cancer research ? 2002 was our most successful year ever . we netted for breast cancer alone , that year alone , 71 million dollars after all expenses . and then we went out of business , suddenly and traumatically . why ? well , the short story is , our sponsor split on us . they wanted to distance themselves from us because we were being crucified in the media for investing 40 percent of the gross in recruitment and customer service and the magic of the experience and there is no accounting terminology to describe that kind of investment in growth and in the future , other than this demonic label of overhead . so on one day , all 350 of our great employees lost their jobs because they were labeled overhead . our sponsor went and tried the events on their own . the overhead went up . net income for breast cancer research went down by 84 percent , or 60 million dollars in one year . this is what happens when we confuse morality with frugality . we 've all been taught that the bake sale with five percent overhead is morally superior to the professional fundraising enterprise with 40 percent overhead , but we 're missing the most important piece of information , which is , what is the actual size of these pies ? who cares if the bake sale only has five percent overhead if it 's tiny ? what if the bake sale only netted 71 dollars for charity because it made no investment in its scale and the professional fundraising enterprise netted 71 million dollars because it did ? now which pie would we prefer , and which pie do we think people who are hungry would prefer ? here 's how all of this impacts the big picture . i said that charitable giving is two percent of gdp in the united states . that 's about 300 billion dollars a year . but only about 20 percent of that , or 60 billion dollars , goes to health and human services causes . the rest goes to religion and higher education and hospitals and that 60 billion dollars is not nearly enough to tackle these problems . but if we could move charitable giving from two percent of gdp up just one step to three percent of gdp , by investing in that growth , that would be an extra 150 billion dollars a year in contributions , and if that money could go disproportionately to health and human services charities , because those were the ones we encouraged to invest in their growth , that would represent a tripling of contributions to that sector . now we 're talking scale . now we 're talking the potential for real change . but it 's never going to happen by forcing these organizations to lower their horizons to the demoralizing objective of keeping their overhead low . our generation does not want its epitaph to read , " we kept charity overhead low . " we want it to read that we changed the world , and that part of the way we did that was by changing the way we think about these things . so the next time you 're looking at a charity , do n't ask about the rate of their overhead . ask about the scale of their dreams , their apple - , google - , amazon - scale dreams , how they measure their progress toward those dreams , and what resources they need to make them come true regardless of what the overhead is . who cares what the overhead is if these problems are actually getting solved ? if we can have that kind of generosity , a generosity of thought , then the non - profit sector can play a massive role in changing the world for all those citizens most desperately in need of it to change . and if that can be our generation 's enduring legacy , that we took responsibility for the thinking that had been handed down to us , that we revisited it , we revised it , and we reinvented the whole way humanity thinks about changing things , forever , for everyone , well , i thought i would let the kids sum up what that would be . annalisa smith - pallotta : that would be -- sage smith - pallotta : -- a real social -- rider smith - pallotta : -- innovation . dan pallotta : thank you very much . thank you . thank you .
technology	the kraken , a beast so terrifying it was said to devour men and ships and whales , and so enormous it could be mistaken for an island . in assessing the merits of such tales , it 's probably wise to keep in mind that old sailor 's saw that the only difference between a fairytale and a sea story is a fairytale begins , " once upon a time , " and a sea story begins , " this ai n't no shit . " every fish that gets away grows with every telling of the tale . nevertheless , there are giants in the ocean , and we now have video proof , as those of you that saw the discovery channel documentary are no doubt aware . i was one of the three scientists on this expedition that took place last summer off japan . i 'm the short one . the other two are dr. tsunemi kubodera and dr. steve o'shea . i owe my participation in this now - historic event to ted . in 2010 , there was a ted event called mission blue held aboard the lindblad explorer in the galapagos as part of the fulfillment of sylvia earle 's ted wish . i spoke about a new way of exploring the ocean , one that focuses on attracting animals instead of scaring them away . mike degruy was also invited , and he spoke with great passion about his love of the ocean , and he also talked to me about applying my approach to something he 's been involved with for a very long time , which is the hunt for the giant squid . it was mike that got me invited to the squid summit , a gathering of squid experts at the discovery channel that summer during shark week . i gave a talk on unobtrusive viewing and optical luring of deep sea squid in which i emphasized the importance of using quiet , unobtrusive platforms for exploration . this came out of hundreds of dives i have made , farting around in the dark using these platforms , and my impression that i saw more animals working from the submersible than i did with either of the remote - operated vehicles . but that could just be because the submersible has a wider field of view . but i also felt like i saw more animals working with the tiburon than the ventana , two vehicles with the same field of view but different propulsion systems . so my suspicion was that it might have something to do with the amount of noise they make . so i set up a hydrophone on the bottom of the ocean , and i had each of these fly by at the same speed and distance and recorded the sound they made . the johnson sea - link -- -- which you can probably just barely hear here , uses electric thrusters -- very , very quiet . the tiburon also uses electric powered thrusters . it 's also pretty quiet , but a bit noisier . but most deep - diving rovs these days use hydraulics and they sound like the ventana . i think that 's got to be scaring a lot of animals away . so for the deep sea squid hunt , i proposed using an optical lure attached to a camera platform with no thrusters , no motors , just a battery - powered camera , and the only illumination coming from red light that 's invisible to most deep - sea animals that are adapted to see primarily blue . that 's visible to our eye , but it 's the equivalent of infrared in the deep sea . so this camera platform , which we called the medusa , could just be thrown off the back of the ship , attached to a float at the surface with over 2,000 feet of line , it would just float around passively carried by the currents , and the only light visible to the animals in the deep would be the blue light of the optical lure , which we called the electronic jellyfish , or e-jelly , because it was designed to imitate the bioluminescent display of the common deep sea jellyfish atolla . now , this pinwheel of light that the atolla produces is known as a bioluminescent burglar alarm and is a form of defense . the reason that the electronic jellyfish worked as a lure is not because giant squid eat jellyfish , but it 's because this jellyfish only resorts to producing this light when it 's being chewed on by a predator and its only hope for escape may be to attract the attention of a larger predator that will attack its attacker and thereby afford it an opportunity for escape . it 's a scream for help , a last - ditch attempt for escape , and a common form of defense in the deep sea . the approach worked . whereas all previous expeditions had failed to garner a single video glimpse of the giant , we managed six , and the first triggered wild excitement . edith widder : oh my god . oh my god ! are you kidding me ? other scientists : oh ho ho ! that 's just hanging there . ew : it was like it was teasing us , doing a kind of fan dance -- now you see me , now you do n't -- and we had four such teasing appearances , and then on the fifth , it came in and totally wowed us . narrator : scientists : ooh . bang ! oh my god ! whoa ! ew : the full monty . what really wowed me about that was the way it came in up over the e-jelly and then attacked the enormous thing next to it , which i think it mistook for the predator on the e - jelly . but even more incredible was the footage shot from the triton submersible . what was not mentioned in the discovery documentary was that the bait squid that dr. kubodera used , a one - meter long diamondback squid had a light attached to it , a squid jig of the type that longline fishermen use , and i think it was this light that brought the giant in . now , what you 're seeing is the intensified camera 's view under red light , and that 's all dr. kubodera could see when the giant comes in here . and then he got so excited , he turned on his flashlight because he wanted to see better , and the giant did n't run away , so he risked turning on the white lights on the submersible , bringing a creature of legend from the misty history into high - resolution video . it was absolutely breathtaking , and had this animal had its feeding tentacles intact and fully extended , it would have been as tall as a two - story house . how could something that big live in our ocean and yet remain unfilmed until now ? we 've only explored about five percent of our ocean . there are great discoveries yet to be made down there , fantastic creatures representing millions of years of evolution and possibly bioactive compounds that could benefit us in ways that we ca n't even yet imagine . yet we have spent only a tiny fraction of the money on ocean exploration that we 've spent on space exploration . we need a nasa - like organization for ocean exploration , because we need to be exploring and protecting our life support systems here on earth . we need -- thank you . exploration is the engine that drives innovation . innovation drives economic growth . so let 's all go exploring , but let 's do it in a way that does n't scare the animals away , or , as mike degruy once said , " if you want to get away from it all and see something you 've never seen , or have an excellent chance of seeing something that no one 's ever seen , get in a sub . " he should have been with us for this adventure . we miss him .
art	so , i 'm an artist . i live in new york , and i 've been working in advertising for -- ever since i left school , so about seven , eight years now , and it was draining . i worked a lot of late nights . i worked a lot of weekends , and i found myself never having time for all the projects that i wanted to work on on my own . and one day i was at work and i saw a talk by stefan sagmeister on ted , and it was called " the power of time off , " and he spoke about how every seven years , he takes a year off from work so he could do his own creative projects , and i was instantly inspired , and i just said , " i have to do that . i have to take a year off . i need to take time to travel and spend time with my family and start my own creative ideas . " so the first of those projects ended up being something i called " one second every day . " basically i 'm recording one second of every day of my life for the rest of my life , chronologically compiling these one - second tiny slices of my life into one single continuous video until , you know , i ca n't record them anymore . the purpose of this project is , one : i hate not remembering things that i 've done in the past . there 's all these things that i 've done with my life that i have no recollection of unless someone brings it up , and sometimes i think , " oh yeah , that 's something that i did . " and something that i realized early on in the project was that if i was n't doing anything interesting , i would probably forget to record the video . so the day -- the first time that i forgot , it really hurt me , because it 's something that i really wanted to -- from the moment that i turned 30 , i wanted to keep this project going until forever , and having missed that one second , i realized , it just kind of created this thing in my head where i never forgot ever again . so if i live to see 80 years of age , i 'm going to have a five - hour video that encapsulates 50 years of my life . when i turn 40 , i 'll have a one - hour video that includes just my 30s . this has really invigorated me day - to - day , when i wake up , to try and do something interesting with my day . now , one of the things that i have issues with is that , as the days and weeks and months go by , time just seems to start blurring and blending into each other and , you know , i hated that , and visualization is the way to trigger memory . you know , this project for me is a way for me to bridge that gap and remember everything that i 've done . even just this one second allows me to remember everything else i did that one day . it 's difficult , sometimes , to pick that one second . on a good day , i 'll have maybe three or four seconds that i really want to choose , but i 'll just have to narrow it down to one , but even narrowing it down to that one allows me to remember the other three anyway . it 's also kind of a protest , a personal protest , against the culture we have now where people just are at concerts with their cell phones out recording the whole concert , and they 're disturbing you . they 're not even enjoying the show . they 're watching the concert through their cell phone . i hate that . i admittedly used to be that guy a little bit , back in the day , and i 've decided that the best way for me to still capture and keep a visual memory of my life and not be that person , is to just record that one second that will allow me to trigger that memory of , " yeah , that concert was amazing . i really loved that concert . " and it just takes a quick , quick second . i was on a three - month road trip this summer . it was something that i 've been dreaming about doing my whole life , just driving around the u.s. and canada and just figuring out where to go the next day , and it was kind of outstanding . i actually ran out , i spent too much money on my road trip for the savings that i had to take my year off , so i had to , i went to seattle and i spent some time with friends working on a really neat project . one of the reasons that i took my year off was to spend more time with my family , and this really tragic thing happened where my sister - in - law , her intestine suddenly strangled one day , and we took her to the emergency room , and she was , she was in really bad shape . we almost lost her a couple of times , and i was there with my brother every day . it helped me realize something else during this project , is that recording that one second on a really bad day is extremely difficult . it 's not -- we tend to take our cameras out when we 're doing awesome things . or we 're , " oh , yeah , this party , let me take a picture . " but we rarely do that when we 're having a bad day , and something horrible is happening . and i found that it 's actually been very , very important to record even just that one second of a really bad moment . it really helps you appreciate the good times . it 's not always a good day , so when you have a bad one , i think it 's important to remember it , just as much as it is important to remember the [ good ] days . now one of the things that i do is i do n't use any filters , i do n't use anything to -- i try to capture the moment as much as possible as the way that i saw it with my own eyes . i started a rule of first person perspective . early on , i think i had a couple of videos where you would see me in it , but i realized that was n't the way to go . the way to really remember what i saw was to record it as i actually saw it . now a couple of things that i have in my head about this project are , would n't it be interesting if thousands of people were doing this ? i turned 31 last week , which is there . i think it would be interesting to see what everyone did with a project like this . i think everyone would have a different interpretation of it . i think everyone would benefit from just having that one second to remember every day . personally , i 'm tired of forgetting , and this is a really easy thing to do . i mean , we all have hd - capable cameras in our pockets right now -- most people in this room , i bet -- and it 's something that 's -- i never want to forget another day that i 've ever lived , and this is my way of doing that , and it 'd be really interesting also to see , if you could just type in on a website , " june 18 , 2018 , " and you would just see a stream of people 's lives on that particular day from all over the world . and i do n't know , i think this project has a lot of possibilities , and i encourage you all to record just a small snippet of your life every day , so you can never forget that that day , you lived . thank you .
culture entertainment	hello , doha . hello . salaam alaikum . i love coming to doha . it 's such an international place . this is like -- it feels like the united nations just here . you land at the airport , and you 're welcomed by an indian lady who takes you to al maha services , where you meet a filipino lady who hands you off to a south african lady who then takes you to a korean who takes you to a pakistani guy with the luggage who takes you to the car with a sri lankan . you go to the hotel and you check in . there 's a lebanese . yeah ? and then a swedish guy showed me my room . i said , " where are the qataris ? " they said , " no , no , it 's too hot . they come out later . they 're smart . " " they know . " and of course it 's growing so fast , sometimes there 's growing pains . you know , like sometimes you run into people that you think know the city well , but they do n't know it that well . my indian cab driver showed up at the w , and i asked him to take me to the sheraton , and he said , " no problem , sir . " and then we sat there for two minutes . i said , " what 's wrong ? " he said , " one problem , sir . " i said , " what ? " he goes , " where is it ? " i go , " you 're the driver , you should know . " he goes , " no , i just arrived , sir . " i go , " you just arrived at the w ? " " no , i just arrived in doha , sir . i was on my way home from the airport . i got a job . i 'm working already . " he goes , " sir , why do n't you drive ? " i go , " i do n't know where we 're going . " " neither do i. it will be an adventure , sir . " it is an adventure . the middle east has been an adventure the past couple years . the middle east is going crazy with the arab spring and revolution and all this . are there any lebanese here tonight ? any lebanese by applause ? lebanese . yeah . the middle east is going crazy . you know the middle east is going crazy when lebanon is the most peaceful place in the region . who would have thought ? oh my gosh . no. there 's serious issues in the region . some people do n't want to talk about them . i 'm here to talk about them tonight . ladies and gentlemen of the middle east , here 's a serious issue . when we see each other , when we say hello , how many kisses are we going to do ? every country is different and it 's confusing , okay ? in lebanon , they do three . in egypt , they do two . i was in lebanon , i got used to three . i went to egypt . i went to say hello to this one egyptian guy , i went , one , two . i went for three . he was n't into it . i told him , i said , " no , no , no , i was just in lebanon . " he goes , " i do n't care where you were . you just stay where you are , please . just stay where you are . " i went to saudi arabia . in saudi arabia , they go one , two , and then they stay on the same side -- three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 . next time you see a saudi , look closely . they 're just a little bit tilted . " abdul , are you okay ? " " yeah , i was saying hello for half an hour . i 'm going to be all right . " qataris , you guys do the nose to nose . why is that ? are you too tired to go all the way around ? " habibi , it 's so hot . just come here for a second . say hello . hello , habibi . just do n't move . just stay there please . i need to rest . " every country -- iranians , sometimes we do two , sometimes we do three . a friend of mine explained to me , before the '79 revolution , it was two . after the revolution , three . so with iranians , you can tell whose side the person is on based on the number of kisses they give you . yeah , if you go one , two , three -- " i ca n't believe you support this regime with your three kisses . " but no , guys , really , it is exciting to be here , and like i said , you guys are doing a lot culturally , you know , and it 's amazing , and it helps change the image of the middle east in the west . like a lot of americans do n't know a lot about us , about the middle east . i 'm iranian and american . i 'm there . i know , i 've traveled here . there 's so much , we laugh , right ? people do n't know we laugh . when i did the axis of evil comedy tour , it came out on comedy central , i went online to see what people were saying about it . i ended up on a conservative website . one guy wrote another guy . he said , " i never knew these people laughed . " think about it . you never see us laughing in american film or television , right ? maybe like an evil -- like , " wuhahaha , wuhahaha . i will kill you in the name of allah , wuhahahahaha . " but never like , " ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha . " we like to laugh . we like to celebrate life . and i wish more americans would travel here . i always encourage my friends : travel , see the middle east , there 's so much to see , so many good people . and it 's vice versa , and it helps stop problems of misunderstanding and stereotypes from happening . for example , i do n't know if you heard about this , a little while ago in the u.s. there was a muslim family walking down the aisle of an airplane talking about the safest place to sit on the plane . some passengers overheard them , somehow misconstrued that as terrorist talk , got them kicked off the plane . it was a family , a mother , father , child , walking down the aisle , talking about the seating . now as a middle eastern male , i know there 's certain things i 'm not supposed to say on an airplane in the u.s. , right ? i 'm not supposed to be , like , walking down the aisle , and be like , " hi , jack . " you know , that 's not cool . even if i 'm there with my friend named jack , i say , " greetings , jack . salutations , jack . " never " hi , jack . " but now apparently we ca n't even talk about the safest place to sit on an airplane . so my advice to all my middle eastern friends and muslim friends and anyone who looks middle eastern or muslim , so to , you know , indians , and latinos , everyone , if you 're brown -- here 's my advice to my brown friends . the next time you 're on an airplane in the u.s. , just speak your mother tongue . that way no one knows what you 're saying . life goes on . granted , some mother tongues might sound a little threatening to the average american , right ? if you 're walking down the aisle speaking arabic , you might freak them out , if you 're walking , " [ arabic ] , " they might say , " what 's he talking about ? " so the key , to my arab brothers and sisters , you gotta throw in random good words to put people at ease as you 're walking down the aisle . just as you 're walking down : " [ imitating arabic ] -- strawberry ! " " [ imitating arabic ] -- rainbow ! " " [ imitating arabic ] -- tutti frutti ! " " i think he 's going to hijack the plane with some ice cream . " thank you very much . have a good night . thank you , ted .
global	chris anderson asked me if i could put the last 25 years of anti - poverty campaigning into 10 minutes for ted . that 's an englishman asking an irishman to be succinct . i said , " chris , that would take a miracle . " he said , " bono , would n't that be a good use of your messianic complex ? " so , yeah . then i thought , let 's go even further than 25 years . let 's go back before christ , three millennia , to a time when , at least in my head , the journey for justice , the march against inequality and poverty really began . three thousand years ago , civilization just getting started on the banks of the nile , some slaves , jewish shepherds in this instance , smelling of sheep shit , i guess , proclaimed to the pharaoh , sitting high on his throne , " we , your majesty - ness , are equal to you . " and the pharaoh replies , " oh , no. you , your miserableness , have got to be kidding . " and they say , " no , no , that 's what it says here in our holy book . " cut to our century , same country , same pyramids , another people spreading the same idea of equality with a different book . this time it 's called the facebook . crowds are gathered in tahrir square . they turn a social network from virtual to actual , and kind of rebooted the 21st century . not to undersell how messy and ugly the aftermath of the arab spring has been , neither to oversell the role of technology , but these things have given a sense of what 's possible when the age - old model of power , the pyramid , gets turned upside down , putting the people on top and the pharaohs of today on the bottom , as it were . it 's also shown us that something as powerful as information and the sharing of it can challenge inequality , because facts , like people , want to be free , and when they 're free , liberty is usually around the corner , even for the poorest of the poor -- facts that can challenge cynicism and the apathy that leads to inertia , facts that tell us what 's working and , more importantly , what 's not , so we can fix it , facts that if we hear them and heed them could help us meet the challenge that nelson mandela made back in 2005 , when he asked us to be that great generation that overcomes that most awful offense to humanity , extreme poverty , facts that build a powerful momentum . so i thought , forget the rock opera , forget the bombast , my usual tricks . the only thing singing today would be the facts , for i have truly embraced by inner nerd . so exit the rock star . enter the evidence - based activist , the factivist . because what the facts are telling us is that the long , slow journey , humanity 's long , slow journey of equality , is actually speeding up . look at what 's been achieved . look at the pictures these data sets print . since the year 2000 , since the turn of the millennium , there are eight million more aids patients getting life - saving antiretroviral drugs . malaria : there are eight countries in sub - saharan africa that have their death rates cut by 75 percent . for kids under five , child mortality , kids under five , it 's down by 2.65 million a year . that 's a rate of 7,256 children 's lives saved each day . wow . wow . let 's just stop for a second , actually , and think about that . have you read anything anywhere in the last week that is remotely as important as that number ? wow . great news . it drives me nuts that most people do n't seem to know this news . seven thousand kids a day . here 's two of them . this is michael and benedicta , and they 're alive thanks in large part to dr. patricia asamoah -- she 's amazing -- and the global fund , which all of you financially support , whether you know it or not . and the global fund provides antiretroviral drugs that stop mothers from passing hiv to their kids . this fantastic news did n't happen by itself . it was fought for , it was campaigned for , it was innovated for . and this great news gives birth to even more great news , because the historic trend is this . the number of people living in back - breaking , soul - crushing extreme poverty has declined from 43 percent of the world 's population in 1990 to 33 percent by 2000 and then to 21 percent by 2010 . give it up for that . halved . halved . now , the rate is still too high -- still too many people unnecessarily losing their lives . there 's still work to do . but it 's heart - stopping . it 's mind - blowing stuff . and if you live on less than $ 1.25 a day , if you live in that kind of poverty , this is not just data . this is everything . if you 're a parent who wants the best for your kids -- and i am -- this rapid transition is a route out of despair and into hope . and guess what ? if the trajectory continues , look where the amount of people living on $ 1.25 a day gets to by 2030 . ca n't be true , can it ? that 's what the data is telling us . if the trajectory continues , we get to , wow , the zero zone . for number - crunchers like us , that is the erogenous zone , and it 's fair to say that i am , by now , sexually aroused by the collating of data . so virtual elimination of extreme poverty , as defined by people living on less than $ 1.25 a day , adjusted , of course , for inflation from a 1990 baseline . we do love a good baseline . that 's amazing . now i know that some of you think this progress is all in asia or latin america or model countries like brazil -- and who does n't love a brazilian model ? -- but look at sub - saharan africa . there 's a collection of 10 countries , some call them the lions , who in the last decade have had a combination of 100 percent debt cancellation , a tripling of aid , a tenfold increase in fdi -- that 's foreign direct investment -- which has unlocked a quadrupling of domestic resources -- that 's local money -- which , when spent wisely -- that 's good governance -- cut childhood mortality by a third , doubled education completion rates , and they , too , halved extreme poverty , and at this rate , these 10 get to zero too . so the pride of lions is the proof of concept . there are all kinds of benefits to this . for a start , you wo n't have to listen to an insufferable little jumped - up jesus like myself . how about that ? and 2028 , 2030 ? it 's just around the corner . i mean , it 's about three rolling stones farewell concerts away . i hope . i 'm hoping . makes us look really young . so why are n't we jumping up and down about this ? well , the opportunity is real , but so is the jeopardy . we ca n't get this done until we really accept that we can get this done . look at this graph . it 's called inertia . it 's how we screw it up . and the next one is really beautiful . it 's called momentum . and it 's how we can bend the arc of history down towards zero , just doing the things that we know work . so inertia versus momentum . there is jeopardy , and of course , the closer you get , it gets harder . we know the obstacles that are in our way right now , in difficult times . in fact , today in your capital , in difficult times , some who mind the nation 's purse want to cut life - saving programs like the global fund . but you can do something about that . you can tell politicians that these cuts [ can cost ] lives . right now today , in oslo as it happens , oil companies are fighting to keep secret their payments to governments for extracting oil in developing countries . you can do something about that too . you can join the one campaign , and leaders like mo ibrahim , the telecom entrepreneur . we 're pushing for laws that make sure that at least some of the wealth under the ground ends up in the hands of the people living above it . and right now , we know that the biggest disease of all is not a disease . it 's corruption . but there 's a vaccine for that too . it 's called transparency , open data sets , something the ted community is really on it . daylight , you could call it , transparency . and technology is really turbocharging this . it 's getting harder to hide if you 're doing bad stuff . so let me tell you about the u - report , which i 'm really excited about . it 's 150,000 millennials all across uganda , young people armed with 2g phones , an sms social network exposing government corruption and demanding to know what 's in the budget and how their money is being spent . this is exciting stuff . look , once you have these tools , you ca n't not use them . once you have this knowledge , you ca n't un - know it . you ca n't delete this data from your brain , but you can delete the cliched image of supplicant , impoverished peoples not taking control of their own lives . you can erase that , you really can , because it 's not true anymore . it 's transformational . 2030 ? by 2030 , robots , not just serving us guinness , but drinking it . by the time we get there , every place with a rough semblance of governance might actually be on their way . so i 'm here to -- i guess we 're here to try and infect you with this virtuous , data - based virus , the one we call factivism . it 's not going to kill you . in fact , it could save countless lives . i guess we in the one campaign would love you to be contagious , spread it , share it , pass it on . by doing so , you will join us and countless others in what i truly believe is the greatest adventure ever taken , the ever - demanding journey of equality . could we really be the great generation that mandela asked us to be ? might we answer that clarion call with science , with reason , with facts , and , dare i say it , emotions ? because as is obvious , factivists have feelings too . i 'm thinking of wael ghonim , though . some of you know him . he set up one of the facebook groups behind the tahrir square in cairo . he got thrown in jail for it , but i have his words tattooed on my brain . " we are going to win because we do n't understand politics . we are going to win because we do n't play their dirty games . we are going to win because we do n't have a party political agenda . we are going to win because the tears that come from our eyes actually come from our hearts . we are going to win because we have dreams , and we 're willing to stand up for those dreams . " wael is right . we 're going to win if we work together as one , because the power of the people is so much stronger than the people in power . thank you . thank you so much .
technology	so , this book that i have in my hand is a directory of everybody who had an email address in 1982 . actually , it 's deceptively large . there 's actually only about 20 people on each page , because we have the name , address and telephone number of every single person . and , in fact , everybody 's listed twice , because it 's sorted once by name and once by email address . obviously a very small community . there were only two other dannys on the internet then . i knew them both . we did n't all know each other , but we all kind of trusted each other , and that basic feeling of trust permeated the whole network , and there was a real sense that we could depend on each other to do things . so just to give you an idea of the level of trust in this community , let me tell you what it was like to register a domain name in the early days . now , it just so happened that i got to register the third domain name on the internet . so i could have anything i wanted other than bbn.com and symbolics.com . so i picked think.com , but then i thought , you know , there 's a lot of really interesting names out there . maybe i should register a few extras just in case . and then i thought , " nah , that would n't be very nice . " that attitude of only taking what you need was really what everybody had on the network in those days , and in fact , it was n't just the people on the network , but it was actually kind of built into the protocols of the internet itself . so the basic idea of i.p. , or internet protocol , and the way that the -- the routing algorithm that used it , were fundamentally " from each according to their ability , to each according to their need . " and so , if you had some extra bandwidth , you 'd deliver a message for someone . if they had some extra bandwidth , they would deliver a message for you . you 'd kind of depend on people to do that , and that was the building block . it was actually interesting that such a communist principle was the basis of a system developed during the cold war by the defense department , but it obviously worked really well , and we all saw what happened with the internet . it was incredibly successful . in fact , it was so successful that there 's no way that these days you could make a book like this . my rough calculation is it would be about 25 miles thick . but , of course , you could n't do it , because we do n't know the names of all the people with internet or email addresses , and even if we did know their names , i 'm pretty sure that they would not want their name , address and telephone number published to everyone . so the fact is that there 's a lot of bad guys on the internet these days , and so we dealt with that by making secure subnetworks , vpns , little things that are n't really the internet but are made out of the same building blocks , but we 're still basically building it out of those same building blocks with those same assumptions of trust . and that means that it 's vulnerable to certain kinds of mistakes that can happen , or certain kinds of deliberate attacks , but even the mistakes can be bad . so , for instance , in all of asia recently , it was impossible to get youtube for a little while because pakistan made some mistakes in how it was censoring youtube in its internal network . they did n't intend to screw up asia , but they did because of the way that the protocols work . another example that may have affected many of you in this audience is , you may remember a couple of years ago , all the planes west of the mississippi were grounded because a single routing card in salt lake city had a bug in it . now , you do n't really think that our airplane system depends on the internet , and in some sense it does n't . i 'll come back to that later . but the fact is that people could n't take off because something was going wrong on the internet , and the router card was down . and so , there are many of those things that start to happen . now , there was an interesting thing that happened last april . all of a sudden , a very large percentage of the traffic on the whole internet , including a lot of the traffic between u.s. military installations , started getting re - routed through china . so for a few hours , it all passed through china . now , china telecom says it was just an honest mistake , and it is actually possible that it was , the way things work , but certainly somebody could make a dishonest mistake of that sort if they wanted to , and it shows you how vulnerable the system is even to mistakes . imagine how vulnerable the system is to deliberate attacks . so if somebody really wanted to attack the united states or western civilization these days , they 're not going to do it with tanks . that will not succeed . what they 'll probably do is something very much like the attack that happened on the iranian nuclear facility . nobody has claimed credit for that . there was basically a factory of industrial machines . it did n't think of itself as being on the internet . it thought of itself as being disconnected from the internet , but it was possible for somebody to smuggle a usb drive in there , or something like that , and software got in there that causes the centrifuges , in that case , to actually destroy themselves . now that same kind of software could destroy an oil refinery or a pharmaceutical factory or a semiconductor plant . and so there 's a lot of -- i 'm sure you 've read a lot in papers , about worries about cyber attacks and defenses against those . but the fact is , people are mostly focused on defending the computers on the internet , and there 's been surprisingly little attention to defending the internet itself as a communications medium . and i think we probably do need to pay some more attention to that , because it 's actually kind of fragile . so actually , in the early days , back when it was the arpanet , there were actually times -- there was a particular time it failed completely because one single message processor actually got a bug in it . and the way the internet works is the routers are basically exchanging information about how they can get messages to places , and this one processor , because of a broken card , decided it could actually get a message to some place in negative time . so , in other words , it claimed it could deliver a message before you sent it . so of course , the fastest way to get a message anywhere was to send it to this guy , who would send it back in time and get it there super early , so every message in the internet started getting switched through this one node , and of course that clogged everything up . everything started breaking . the interesting thing was , though , that the sysadmins were able to fix it , but they had to basically turn every single thing on the internet off . now , of course you could n't do that today . i mean , everything off , it 's like the service call you get from the cable company , except for the whole world . now , in fact , they could n't do it for a lot of reasons today . one of the reasons is a lot of their telephones use ip protocol and use things like skype and so on that go through the internet right now , and so in fact we 're becoming dependent on it for more and more different things , like when you take off from lax , you 're really not thinking you 're using the internet . when you pump gas , you really do n't think you 're using the internet . what 's happening increasingly , though , is these systems are beginning to use the internet . most of them are n't based on the internet yet , but they 're starting to use the internet for service functions , for administrative functions , and so if you take something like the cell phone system , which is still relatively independent of the internet for the most part , internet pieces are beginning to sneak into it in terms of some of the control and administrative functions , and it 's so tempting to use these same building blocks because they work so well , they 're cheap , they 're repeated , and so on . so all of our systems , more and more , are starting to use the same technology and starting to depend on this technology . and so even a modern rocket ship these days actually uses internet protocol to talk from one end of the rocket ship to the other . that 's crazy . it was never designed to do things like that . so we 've built this system where we understand all the parts of it , but we 're using it in a very , very different way than we expected to use it , and it 's gotten a very , very different scale than it was designed for . and in fact , nobody really exactly understands all the things it 's being used for right now . it 's turning into one of these big emergent systems like the financial system , where we 've designed all the parts but nobody really exactly understands how it operates and all the little details of it and what kinds of emergent behaviors it can have . and so if you hear an expert talking about the internet and saying it can do this , or it does do this , or it will do that , you should treat it with the same skepticism that you might treat the comments of an economist about the economy or a weatherman about the weather , or something like that . they have an informed opinion , but it 's changing so quickly that even the experts do n't know exactly what 's going on . so if you see one of these maps of the internet , it 's just somebody 's guess . nobody really knows what the internet is right now because it 's different than it was an hour ago . it 's constantly changing . it 's constantly reconfiguring . and the problem with it is , i think we are setting ourselves up for a kind of disaster like the disaster we had in the financial system , where we take a system that 's basically built on trust , was basically built for a smaller - scale system , and we 've kind of expanded it way beyond the limits of how it was meant to operate . and so right now , i think it 's literally true that we do n't know what the consequences of an effective denial - of - service attack on the internet would be , and whatever it would be is going to be worse next year , and worse next year , and so on . but so what we need is a plan b. there is no plan b right now . there 's no clear backup system that we 've very carefully kept to be independent of the internet , made out of completely different sets of building blocks . so what we need is something that does n't necessarily have to have the performance of the internet , but the police department has to be able to call up the fire department even without the internet , or the hospitals have to order fuel oil . this does n't need to be a multi - billion - dollar government project . it 's actually relatively simple to do , technically , because it can use existing fibers that are in the ground , existing wireless infrastructure . it 's basically a matter of deciding to do it . but people wo n't decide to do it until they recognize the need for it , and that 's the problem that we have right now . so there 's been plenty of people , plenty of us have been quietly arguing that we should have this independent system for years , but it 's very hard to get people focused on plan b when plan a seems to be working so well . so i think that , if people understand how much we 're starting to depend on the internet , and how vulnerable it is , we could get focused on just wanting this other system to exist , and i think if enough people say , " yeah , i would like to use it , i 'd like to have such a system , " then it will get built . it 's not that hard a problem . it could definitely be done by people in this room . and so i think that this is actually , of all the problems you 're going to hear about at the conference , this is probably one of the very easiest to fix . so i 'm happy to get a chance to tell you about it . thank you very much .
science	i 'm a neuroscientist , and i study decision - making . i do experiments to test how different chemicals in the brain influence the choices we make . i 'm here to tell you the secret to successful decision - making : a cheese sandwich . that 's right . according to scientists , a cheese sandwich is the solution to all your tough decisions . how do i know ? i 'm the scientist who did the study . a few years ago , my colleagues and i were interested in how a brain chemical called serotonin would influence people 's decisions in social situations . specifically , we wanted to know how serotonin would affect the way people react when they 're treated unfairly . so we did an experiment . we manipulated people 's serotonin levels by giving them this really disgusting - tasting artificial lemon - flavored drink that works by taking away the raw ingredient for serotonin in the brain . this is the amino acid tryptophan . so what we found was , when tryptophan was low , people were more likely to take revenge when they 're treated unfairly . that 's the study we did , and here are some of the headlines that came out afterwards . at this point , you might be wondering , did i miss something ? cheese ? chocolate ? where did that come from ? and i thought the same thing myself when these came out , because our study had nothing to do with cheese or chocolate . we gave people this horrible - tasting drink that affected their tryptophan levels . but it turns out that tryptophan also happens to be found in cheese and chocolate . and of course when science says cheese and chocolate help you make better decisions , well , that 's sure to grab people 's attention . so there you have it : the evolution of a headline . when this happened , a part of me thought , well , what 's the big deal ? so the media oversimplified a few things , but in the end , it 's just a news story . and i think a lot of scientists have this attitude . but the problem is that this kind of thing happens all the time , and it affects not just the stories you read in the news but also the products you see on the shelves . when the headlines rolled , what happened was , the marketers came calling . would i be willing to provide a scientific endorsement of a mood - boosting bottled water ? or would i go on television to demonstrate , in front of a live audience , that comfort foods really do make you feel better ? i think these folks meant well , but had i taken them up on their offers , i would have been going beyond the science , and good scientists are careful not to do this . but nevertheless , neuroscience is turning up more and more in marketing . here 's one example : neuro drinks , a line of products , including nuero bliss here , which according to its label helps reduce stress , enhances mood , provides focused concentration , and promotes a positive outlook . i have to say , this sounds awesome . i could totally have used this 10 minutes ago . so when this came up in my local shop , naturally i was curious about some of the research backing these claims . so i went to the company 's website looking to find some controlled trials of their products . but i did n't find any . trial or no trial , these claims are front and center on their label right next to a picture of a brain . and it turns out that pictures of brains have special properties . a couple of researchers asked a few hundred people to read a scientific article . for half the people , the article included a brain image , and for the other half , it was the same article but it did n't have a brain image . at the end -- you see where this is going -- people were asked whether they agreed with the conclusions of the article . so this is how much people agree with the conclusions with no image . and this is how much they agree with the same article that did include a brain image . so the take - home message here is , do you want to sell it ? put a brain on it . now let me pause here and take a moment to say that neuroscience has advanced a lot in the last few decades , and we 're constantly discovering amazing things about the brain . like , just a couple of weeks ago , neuroscientists at mit figured out how to break habits in rats just by controlling neural activity in a specific part of their brain . really cool stuff . but the promise of neuroscience has led to some really high expectations and some overblown , unproven claims . so what i 'm going to do is show you how to spot a couple of classic moves , dead giveaways , really , for what 's variously been called neuro - bunk , neuro - bollocks , or , my personal favorite , neuro - flapdoodle . so the first unproven claim is that you can use brain scans to read people 's thoughts and emotions . here 's a study published by a team of researchers as an op - ed in the new york times . the headline ? " you love your iphone . literally . " it quickly became the most emailed article on the site . so how 'd they figure this out ? they put 16 people inside a brain scanner and showed them videos of ringing iphones . the brain scans showed activation in a part of the brain called the insula , a region they say is linked to feelings of love and compassion . so they concluded that because they saw activation in the insula , this meant the subjects loved their iphones . now there 's just one problem with this line of reasoning , and that 's that the insula does a lot . sure , it is involved in positive emotions like love and compassion , but it 's also involved in tons of other processes , like memory , language , attention , even anger , disgust and pain . so based on the same logic , i could equally conclude you hate your iphone . the point here is , when you see activation in the insula , you ca n't just pick and choose your favorite explanation from off this list , and it 's a really long list . my colleagues tal yarkoni and russ poldrack have shown that the insula pops up in almost a third of all brain imaging studies that have ever been published . so chances are really , really good that your insula is going off right now , but i wo n't kid myself to think this means you love me . so speaking of love and the brain , there 's a researcher , known to some as dr. love , who claims that scientists have found the glue that holds society together , the source of love and prosperity . this time it 's not a cheese sandwich . no , it 's a hormone called oxytocin . you 've probably heard of it . so , dr. love bases his argument on studies showing that when you boost people 's oxytocin , this increases their trust , empathy and cooperation . so he 's calling oxytocin " the moral molecule . " now these studies are scientifically valid , and they 've been replicated , but they 're not the whole story . other studies have shown that boosting oxytocin increases envy . it increases gloating . oxytocin can bias people to favor their own group at the expense of other groups . and in some cases , oxytocin can even decrease cooperation . so based on these studies , i could say oxytocin is an immoral molecule , and call myself dr. strangelove . so we 've seen neuro - flapdoodle all over the headlines . we see it in supermarkets , on book covers . what about the clinic ? spect imaging is a brain - scanning technology that uses a radioactive tracer to track blood flow in the brain . for the bargain price of a few thousand dollars , there are clinics in the u.s. that will give you one of these spect scans and use the image to help diagnose your problems . these scans , the clinics say , can help prevent alzheimer 's disease , solve weight and addiction issues , overcome marital conflicts , and treat , of course , a variety of mental illnesses ranging from depression to anxiety to adhd . this sounds great . a lot of people agree . some of these clinics are pulling in tens of millions of dollars a year in business . there 's just one problem . the broad consensus in neuroscience is that we ca n't yet diagnose mental illness from a single brain scan . but these clinics have treated tens of thousands of patients to date , many of them children , and spect imaging involves a radioactive injection , so exposing people to radiation , potentially harmful . i am more excited than most people , as a neuroscientist , about the potential for neuroscience to treat mental illness and even maybe to make us better and smarter . and if one day we can say that cheese and chocolate help us make better decisions , count me in . but we 're not there yet . we have n't found a " buy " button inside the brain , we ca n't tell whether someone is lying or in love just by looking at their brain scans , and we ca n't turn sinners into saints with hormones . maybe someday we will , but until then , we have to be careful that we do n't let overblown claims detract resources and attention away from the real science that 's playing a much longer game . so here 's where you come in . if someone tries to sell you something with a brain on it , do n't just take them at their word . ask the tough questions . ask to see the evidence . ask for the part of the story that 's not being told . the answers should n't be simple , because the brain is n't simple . but that 's not stopping us from trying to figure it out anyway . thank you .
politics technology	i want to talk to you today about something the open - source programming world can teach democracy , but before that , a little preamble . let 's start here . this is martha payne . martha 's a 9 - year - old scot who lives in the council of argyll and bute . a couple months ago , payne started a food blog called neverseconds , and she would take her camera with her every day to school to document her school lunches . can you spot the vegetable ? and , as sometimes happens , this blog acquired first dozens of readers , and then hundreds of readers , and then thousands of readers , as people tuned in to watch her rate her school lunches , including on my favorite category , " pieces of hair found in food . " this was a zero day . that 's good . and then two weeks ago yesterday , she posted this . a post that read : " goodbye . " and she said , " i 'm very sorry to tell you this , but my head teacher pulled me out of class today and told me i 'm not allowed to take pictures in the lunch room anymore . i really enjoyed doing this . thank you for reading . goodbye . " you can guess what happened next , right ? the outrage was so swift , so voluminous , so unanimous , that the council of argyll and bute reversed themselves the same day and said , " we would , we would never censor a nine - year - old . " except , of course , this morning . and this brings up the question , what made them think they could get away with something like that ? and the answer is , all of human history prior to now . so , what happens when a medium suddenly puts a lot of new ideas into circulation ? now , this is n't just a contemporaneous question . this is something we 've faced several times over the last few centuries . when the telegraph came along , it was clear that it was going to globalize the news industry . what would this lead to ? well , obviously , it would lead to world peace . the television , a medium that allowed us not just to hear but see , literally see , what was going on elsewhere in the world , what would this lead to ? world peace . the telephone ? you guessed it : world peace . sorry for the spoiler alert , but no world peace . not yet . even the printing press , even the printing press was assumed to be a tool that was going to enforce catholic intellectual hegemony across europe . instead , what we got was martin luther 's 95 theses , the protestant reformation , and , you know , the thirty years ' war . all right , so what all of these predictions of world peace got right is that when a lot of new ideas suddenly come into circulation , it changes society . what they got exactly wrong was what happens next . the more ideas there are in circulation , the more ideas there are for any individual to disagree with . more media always means more arguing . that 's what happens when the media 's space expands . and yet , when we look back on the printing press in the early years , we like what happened . we are a pro - printing press society . so how do we square those two things , that it leads to more arguing , but we think it was good ? and the answer , i think , can be found in things like this . this is the cover of " philosophical transactions , " the first scientific journal ever published in english in the middle of the 1600s , and it was created by a group of people who had been calling themselves " the invisible college , " a group of natural philosophers who only later would call themselves scientists , and they wanted to improve the way natural philosophers argued with each other , and they needed to do two things for this . they needed openness . they needed to create a norm which said , when you do an experiment , you have to publish not just your claims , but how you did the experiment . if you do n't tell us how you did it , we wo n't trust you . but the other thing they needed was speed . they had to quickly synchronize what other natural philosophers knew . otherwise , you could n't get the right kind of argument going . the printing press was clearly the right medium for this , but the book was the wrong tool . it was too slow . and so they invented the scientific journal as a way of synchronizing the argument across the community of natural scientists . the scientific revolution was n't created by the printing press . it was created by scientists , but it could n't have been created if they did n't have a printing press as a tool . so what about us ? what about our generation , and our media revolution , the internet ? well , predictions of world peace ? check . more arguing ? gold star on that one . i mean , youtube is just a gold mine . better arguing ? that 's the question . so i study social media , which means , to a first approximation , i watch people argue . and if i had to pick a group that i think is our invisible college , is our generation 's collection of people trying to take these tools and to press it into service , not for more arguments , but for better arguments , i 'd pick the open - source programmers . programming is a three - way relationship between a programmer , some source code , and the computer it 's meant to run on , but computers are such famously inflexible interpreters of instructions that it 's extraordinarily difficult to write out a set of instructions that the computer knows how to execute , and that 's if one person is writing it . once you get more than one person writing it , it 's very easy for any two programmers to overwrite each other 's work if they 're working on the same file , or to send incompatible instructions that simply causes the computer to choke , and this problem grows larger the more programmers are involved . to a first approximation , the problem of managing a large software project is the problem of keeping this social chaos at bay . now , for decades there has been a canonical solution to this problem , which is to use something called a " version control system , " and a version control system does what is says on the tin . it provides a canonical copy of the software on a server somewhere . the only programmers who can change it are people who 've specifically been given permission to access it , and they 're only allowed to access the sub - section of it that they have permission to change . and when people draw diagrams of version control systems , the diagrams always look something like this . all right . they look like org charts . and you do n't have to squint very hard to see the political ramifications of a system like this . this is feudalism : one owner , many workers . now , that 's fine for the commercial software industry . it really is microsoft 's office . it 's adobe 's photoshop . the corporation owns the software . the programmers come and go . but there was one programmer who decided that this was n't the way to work . this is linus torvalds . torvalds is the most famous open - source programmer , created linux , obviously , and torvalds looked at the way the open - source movement had been dealing with this problem . open - source software , the core promise of the open - source license , is that everybody should have access to all the source code all the time , but of course , this creates the very threat of chaos you have to forestall in order to get anything working . so most open - source projects just held their noses and adopted the feudal management systems . but torvalds said , " no , i 'm not going to do that . " his point of view on this was very clear . when you adopt a tool , you also adopt the management philosophy embedded in that tool , and he was n't going to adopt anything that did n't work the way the linux community worked . and to give you a sense of how enormous a decision like this was , this is a map of the internal dependencies within linux , within the linux operating system , which sub - parts of the program rely on which other sub - parts to get going . this is a tremendously complicated process . this is a tremendously complicated program , and yet , for years , torvalds ran this not with automated tools but out of his email box . people would literally mail him changes that they 'd agreed on , and he would merge them by hand . and then , 15 years after looking at linux and figuring out how the community worked , he said , " i think i know how to write a version control system for free people . " and he called it " git . " git is distributed version control . it has two big differences with traditional version control systems . the first is that it lives up to the philosophical promise of open - source . everybody who works on a project has access to all of the source code all of the time . and when people draw diagrams of git workflow , they use drawings that look like this . and you do n't have to understand what the circles and boxes and arrows mean to see that this is a far more complicated way of working than is supported by ordinary version control systems . but this is also the thing that brings the chaos back , and this is git 's second big innovation . this is a screenshot from github , the premier git hosting service , and every time a programmer uses git to make any important change at all , creating a new file , modifying an existing one , merging two files , git creates this kind of signature . this long string of numbers and letters here is a unique identifier tied to every single change , but without any central coordination . every git system generates this number the same way , which means this is a signature tied directly and unforgeably to a particular change . this has the following effect : a programmer in edinburgh and a programmer in entebbe can both get the same -- a copy of the same piece of software . each of them can make changes and they can merge them after the fact even if they did n't know of each other 's existence beforehand . this is cooperation without coordination . this is the big change . now , i tell you all of this not to convince you that it 's great that open - source programmers now have a tool that supports their philosophical way of working , although i think that is great . i tell you all of this because of what i think it means for the way communities come together . once git allowed for cooperation without coordination , you start to see communities form that are enormously large and complex . this is a graph of the ruby community . it 's an open - source programming language , and all of the interconnections between the people -- this is now not a software graph , but a people graph , all of the interconnections among the people working on that project -- and this does n't look like an org chart . this looks like a dis - org chart , and yet , out of this community , but using these tools , they can now create something together . so there are two good reasons to think that this kind of technique can be applied to democracies in general and in particular to the law . when you make the claim , in fact , that something on the internet is going to be good for democracy , you often get this reaction . which is , are you talking about the thing with the singing cats ? like , is that the thing you think is going to be good for society ? to which i have to say , here 's the thing with the singing cats . that always happens . and i do n't just mean that always happens with the internet , i mean that always happens with media , full stop . it did not take long after the rise of the commercial printing press before someone figured out that erotic novels were a good idea . you do n't have to have an economic incentive to sell books very long before someone says , " hey , you know what i bet people would pay for ? " it took people another 150 years to even think of the scientific journal , right ? so -- so the harnessing by the invisible college of the printing press to create the scientific journal was phenomenally important , but it did n't happen big , and it did n't happen quick , and it did n't happen fast , so if you 're going to look for where the change is happening , you have to look on the margins . so , the law is also dependency - related . this is a graph of the u.s. tax code , and the dependencies of one law on other laws for the overall effect . so there 's that as a site for source code management . but there 's also the fact that law is another place where there are many opinions in circulation , but they need to be resolved to one canonical copy , and when you go onto github , and you look around , there are millions and millions of projects , almost all of which are source code , but if you look around the edges , you can see people experimenting with the political ramifications of a system like that . someone put up all the wikileaked cables from the state department , along with software used to interpret them , including my favorite use ever of the cablegate cables , which is a tool for detecting naturally occurring haiku in state department prose . right . the new york senate has put up something called open legislation , also hosting it on github , again for all of the reasons of updating and fluidity . you can go and pick your senator and then you can see a list of bills they have sponsored . someone going by divegeek has put up the utah code , the laws of the state of utah , and they 've put it up there not just to distribute the code , but with the very interesting possibility that this could be used to further the development of legislation . somebody put up a tool during the copyright debate last year in the senate , saying , " it 's strange that hollywood has more access to canadian legislators than canadian citizens do . why do n't we use github to show them what a citizen - developed bill might look like ? " and it includes this very evocative screenshot . this is a called a " diff , " this thing on the right here . this shows you , for text that many people are editing , when a change was made , who made it , and what the change is . the stuff in red is the stuff that got deleted . the stuff in green is the stuff that got added . programmers take this capability for granted . no democracy anywhere in the world offers this feature to its citizens for either legislation or for budgets , even though those are the things done with our consent and with our money . now , i would love to tell you that the fact that the open - source programmers have worked out a collaborative method that is large scale , distributed , cheap , and in sync with the ideals of democracy , i would love to tell you that because those tools are in place , the innovation is inevitable . but it 's not . part of the problem , of course , is just a lack of information . somebody put a question up on quora saying , " why is it that lawmakers do n't use distributed version control ? " this , graphically , was the answer . and that is indeed part of the problem , but only part . the bigger problem , of course , is power . the people experimenting with participation do n't have legislative power , and the people who have legislative power are not experimenting with participation . they are experimenting with openness . there 's no democracy worth the name that does n't have a transparency move , but transparency is openness in only one direction , and being given a dashboard without a steering wheel has never been the core promise a democracy makes to its citizens . so consider this . the thing that got martha payne 's opinions out into the public was a piece of technology , but the thing that kept them there was political will . it was the expectation of the citizens that she would not be censored . that 's now the state we 're in with these collaboration tools . we have them . we 've seen them . they work . can we use them ? can we apply the techniques that worked here to this ? t.s. eliot once said , " one of the most momentous things that can happen to a culture is that they acquire a new form of prose . " i think that 's wrong , but -- i think it 's right for argumentation . right ? a momentous thing that can happen to a culture is they can acquire a new style of arguing : trial by jury , voting , peer review , now this . right ? a new form of arguing has been invented in our lifetimes , in the last decade , in fact . it 's large , it 's distributed , it 's low - cost , and it 's compatible with the ideals of democracy . the question for us now is , are we going to let the programmers keep it to themselves ? or are we going to try and take it and press it into service for society at large ? thank you for listening . thank you . thank you .
economics business	the global economic financial crisis has reignited public interest in something that 's actually one of the oldest questions in economics , dating back to at least before adam smith . and that is , why is it that countries with seemingly similar economies and institutions can display radically different savings behavior ? now , many brilliant economists have spent their entire lives working on this question , and as a field we 've made a tremendous amount of headway and we understand a lot about this . what i 'm here to talk with you about today is an intriguing new hypothesis and some surprisingly powerful new findings that i 've been working on about the link between the structure of the language you speak and how you find yourself with the propensity to save . let me tell you a little bit about savings rates , a little bit about language , and then i 'll draw that connection . let 's start by thinking about the member countries of the oecd , or the organization of economic cooperation and development . oecd countries , by and large , you should think about these as the richest , most industrialized countries in the world . and by joining the oecd , they were affirming a common commitment to democracy , open markets and free trade . despite all of these similarities , we see huge differences in savings behavior . so all the way over on the left of this graph , what you see is many oecd countries saving over a quarter of their gdp every year , and some oecd countries saving over a third of their gdp per year . holding down the right flank of the oecd , all the way on the other side , is greece . and what you can see is that over the last 25 years , greece has barely managed to save more than 10 percent of their gdp . it should be noted , of course , that the united states and the u.k. are the next in line . now that we see these huge differences in savings rates , how is it possible that language might have something to do with these differences ? let me tell you a little bit about how languages fundamentally differ . linguists and cognitive scientists have been exploring this question for many years now . and then i 'll draw the connection between these two behaviors . many of you have probably already noticed that i 'm chinese . i grew up in the midwest of the united states . and something i realized quite early on was that the chinese language forced me to speak about and -- in fact , more fundamentally than that -- ever so slightly forced me to think about family in very different ways . now , how might that be ? let me give you an example . suppose i were talking with you and i was introducing you to my uncle . you understood exactly what i just said in english . if we were speaking mandarin chinese with each other , though , i would n't have that luxury . i would n't have been able to convey so little information . what my language would have forced me to do , instead of just telling you , " this is my uncle , " is to tell you a tremendous amount of additional information . my language would force me to tell you whether or not this was an uncle on my mother 's side or my father 's side , whether this was an uncle by marriage or by birth , and if this man was my father 's brother , whether he was older than or younger than my father . all of this information is obligatory . chinese does n't let me ignore it . and in fact , if i want to speak correctly , chinese forces me to constantly think about it . now , that fascinated me endlessly as a child , but what fascinates me even more today as an economist is that some of these same differences carry through to how languages speak about time . so for example , if i 'm speaking in english , i have to speak grammatically differently if i 'm talking about past rain , " it rained yesterday , " current rain , " it is raining now , " or future rain , " it will rain tomorrow . " notice that english requires a lot more information with respect to the timing of events . why ? because i have to consider that and i have to modify what i 'm saying to say , " it will rain , " or " it 's going to rain . " it 's simply not permissible in english to say , " it rain tomorrow . " in contrast to that , that 's almost exactly what you would say in chinese . a chinese speaker can basically say something that sounds very strange to an english speaker 's ears . they can say , " yesterday it rain , " " now it rain , " " tomorrow it rain . " in some deep sense , chinese does n't divide up the time spectrum in the same way that english forces us to constantly do in order to speak correctly . is this difference in languages only between very , very distantly related languages , like english and chinese ? actually , no. so many of you know , in this room , that english is a germanic language . what you may not have realized is that english is actually an outlier . it is the only germanic language that requires this . for example , most other germanic language speakers feel completely comfortable talking about rain tomorrow by saying , " morgen regnet es , " quite literally to an english ear , " it rain tomorrow . " this led me , as a behavioral economist , to an intriguing hypothesis . could how you speak about time , could how your language forces you to think about time , affect your propensity to behave across time ? you speak english , a futured language . and what that means is that every time you discuss the future , or any kind of a future event , grammatically you 're forced to cleave that from the present and treat it as if it 's something viscerally different . now suppose that that visceral difference makes you subtly dissociate the future from the present every time you speak . if that 's true and it makes the future feel like something more distant and more different from the present , that 's going to make it harder to save . if , on the other hand , you speak a futureless language , the present and the future , you speak about them identically . if that subtly nudges you to feel about them identically , that 's going to make it easier to save . now this is a fanciful theory . i 'm a professor , i get paid to have fanciful theories . but how would you actually go about testing such a theory ? well , what i did with that was to access the linguistics literature . and interestingly enough , there are pockets of futureless language speakers situated all over the world . this is a pocket of futureless language speakers in northern europe . interestingly enough , when you start to crank the data , these pockets of futureless language speakers all around the world turn out to be , by and large , some of the world 's best savers . just to give you a hint of that , let 's look back at that oecd graph that we were talking about . what you see is that these bars are systematically taller and systematically shifted to the left compared to these bars which are the members of the oecd that speak futured languages . what is the average difference here ? five percentage points of your gdp saved per year . over 25 years that has huge long - run effects on the wealth of your nation . now while these findings are suggestive , countries can be different in so many different ways that it 's very , very difficult sometimes to account for all of these possible differences . what i 'm going to show you , though , is something that i 've been engaging in for a year , which is trying to gather all of the largest datasets that we have access to as economists , and i 'm going to try and strip away all of those possible differences , hoping to get this relationship to break . and just in summary , no matter how far i push this , i ca n't get it to break . let me show you how far you can do that . one way to imagine that is i gather large datasets from around the world . so for example , there is the survey of health , [ aging ] and retirement in europe . from this dataset you actually learn that retired european families are extremely patient with survey takers . so imagine that you 're a retired household in belgium and someone comes to your front door . " excuse me , would you mind if i peruse your stock portfolio ? do you happen to know how much your house is worth ? do you mind telling me ? would you happen to have a hallway that 's more than 10 meters long ? if you do , would you mind if i timed how long it took you to walk down that hallway ? would you mind squeezing as hard as you can , in your dominant hand , this device so i can measure your grip strength ? how about blowing into this tube so i can measure your lung capacity ? " the survey takes over a day . combine that with a demographic and health survey collected by usaid in developing countries in africa , for example , which that survey actually can go so far as to directly measure the hiv status of families living in , for example , rural nigeria . combine that with a world value survey , which measures the political opinions and , fortunately for me , the savings behaviors of millions of families in hundreds of countries around the world . take all of that data , combine it , and this map is what you get . what you find is nine countries around the world that have significant native populations which speak both futureless and futured languages . and what i 'm going to do is form statistical matched pairs between families that are nearly identical on every dimension that i can measure , and then i 'm going to explore whether or not the link between language and savings holds even after controlling for all of these levels . what are the characteristics we can control for ? well i 'm going to match families on country of birth and residence , the demographics -- what sex , their age -- their income level within their own country , their educational achievement , a lot about their family structure . it turns out there are six different ways to be married in europe . and most granularly , i break them down by religion where there are 72 categories of religions in the world -- so an extreme level of granularity . there are 1.4 billion different ways that a family can find itself . now effectively everything i 'm going to tell you from now on is only comparing these basically nearly identical families . it 's getting as close as possible to the thought experiment of finding two families both of whom live in brussels who are identical on every single one of these dimensions , but one of whom speaks flemish and one of whom speaks french ; or two families that live in a rural district in nigeria , one of whom speaks hausa and one of whom speaks igbo . now even after all of this granular level of control , do futureless language speakers seem to save more ? yes , futureless language speakers , even after this level of control , are 30 percent more likely to report having saved in any given year . does this have cumulative effects ? yes , by the time they retire , futureless language speakers , holding constant their income , are going to retire with 25 percent more in savings . can we push this data even further ? yes , because i just told you , we actually collect a lot of health data as economists . now how can we think about health behaviors to think about savings ? well , think about smoking , for example . smoking is in some deep sense negative savings . if savings is current pain in exchange for future pleasure , smoking is just the opposite . it 's current pleasure in exchange for future pain . what we should expect then is the opposite effect . and that 's exactly what we find . futureless language speakers are 20 to 24 percent less likely to be smoking at any given point in time compared to identical families , and they 're going to be 13 to 17 percent less likely to be obese by the time they retire , and they 're going to report being 21 percent more likely to have used a condom in their last sexual encounter . i could go on and on with the list of differences that you can find . it 's almost impossible not to find a savings behavior for which this strong effect is n't present . my linguistics and economics colleagues at yale and i are just starting to do this work and really explore and understand the ways that these subtle nudges cause us to think more or less about the future every single time we speak . ultimately , the goal , once we understand how these subtle effects can change our decision making , we want to be able to provide people tools so that they can consciously make themselves better savers and more conscious investors in their own future . thank you very much .
science biology health technology	i 'd like to show you a video of some of the models i work with . they 're all the perfect size , and they do n't have an ounce of fat . did i mention they 're gorgeous ? and they 're scientific models ? as you might have guessed , i 'm a tissue engineer , and this is a video of some of the beating heart that i 've engineered in the lab. and one day we hope that these tissues can serve as replacement parts for the human body . but what i 'm going to tell you about today is how these tissues make awesome models . well , let 's think about the drug screening process for a moment . you go from drug formulation , lab testing , animal testing , and then clinical trials , which you might call human testing , before the drugs get to market . it costs a lot of money , a lot of time , and sometimes , even when a drug hits the market , it acts in an unpredictable way and actually hurts people . and the later it fails , the worse the consequences . it all boils down to two issues . one , humans are not rats , and two , despite our incredible similarities to one another , actually those tiny differences between you and i have huge impacts with how we metabolize drugs and how those drugs affect us . so what if we had better models in the lab that could not only mimic us better than rats but also reflect our diversity ? let 's see how we can do it with tissue engineering . one of the key technologies that 's really important is what 's called induced pluripotent stem cells . they were developed in japan pretty recently . okay , induced pluripotent stem cells . they 're a lot like embryonic stem cells except without the controversy . we induce cells , okay , say , skin cells , by adding a few genes to them , culturing them , and then harvesting them . so they 're skin cells that can be tricked , kind of like cellular amnesia , into an embryonic state . so without the controversy , that 's cool thing number one . cool thing number two , you can grow any type of tissue out of them : brain , heart , liver , you get the picture , but out of your cells . so we can make a model of your heart , your brain on a chip . generating tissues of predictable density and behavior is the second piece , and will be really key towards getting these models to be adopted for drug discovery . and this is a schematic of a bioreactor we 're developing in our lab to help engineer tissues in a more modular , scalable way . going forward , imagine a massively parallel version of this with thousands of pieces of human tissue . it would be like having a clinical trial on a chip . but another thing about these induced pluripotent stem cells is that if we take some skin cells , let 's say , from people with a genetic disease and we engineer tissues out of them , we can actually use tissue - engineering techniques to generate models of those diseases in the lab. here 's an example from kevin eggan 's lab at harvard . he generated neurons from these induced pluripotent stem cells from patients who have lou gehrig 's disease , and he differentiated them into neurons , and what 's amazing is that these neurons also show symptoms of the disease . so with disease models like these , we can fight back faster than ever before and understand the disease better than ever before , and maybe discover drugs even faster . this is another example of patient - specific stem cells that were engineered from someone with retinitis pigmentosa . this is a degeneration of the retina . it 's a disease that runs in my family , and we really hope that cells like these will help us find a cure . so some people think that these models sound well and good , but ask , " well , are these really as good as the rat ? " the rat is an entire organism , after all , with interacting networks of organs . a drug for the heart can get metabolized in the liver , and some of the byproducts may be stored in the fat . do n't you miss all that with these tissue - engineered models ? well , this is another trend in the field . by combining tissue engineering techniques with microfluidics , the field is actually evolving towards just that , a model of the entire ecosystem of the body , complete with multiple organ systems to be able to test how a drug you might take for your blood pressure might affect your liver or an antidepressant might affect your heart . these systems are really hard to build , but we 're just starting to be able to get there , but that 's not even all of it , because once a drug is approved , tissue engineering techniques can actually help us develop more personalized treatments . this is an example that you might care about someday , and i hope you never do , because imagine if you ever get that call that gives you that bad news that you might have cancer . would n't you rather test to see if those cancer drugs you 're going to take are going to work on your cancer ? this is an example from karen burg 's lab , where they 're using inkjet technologies to print breast cancer cells and study its progressions and treatments . and some of our colleagues at tufts are mixing models like these with tissue - engineered bone to see how cancer might spread from one part of the body to the next , and you can imagine those kinds of multi - tissue chips to be the next generation of these kinds of studies . and so thinking about the models that we 've just discussed , you can see , going forward , that tissue engineering is actually poised to help revolutionize drug screening at every single step of the path : disease models making for better drug formulations , massively parallel human tissue models helping to revolutionize lab testing , reduce animal testing and human testing in clinical trials , and individualized therapies that disrupt what we even consider to be a market at all . essentially , we 're dramatically speeding up that feedback between developing a molecule and learning about how it acts in the human body . our process for doing this is essentially transforming biotechnology and pharmacology into an information technology , helping us discover and evaluate drugs faster , more cheaply and more effectively . it gives new meaning to models against animal testing , does n't it ? thank you .
technology	good morning . so magic is an excellent way for staying ahead of the reality curve , to make possible today what science will make a reality tomorrow . as a cyber - magician , i combine elements of illusion and science to give us a feel of how future technologies might be experienced . you 've probably all heard of google 's project glass . it 's new technology . you look through them and the world you see is augmented with data : names of places , monuments , buildings , maybe one day even the names of the strangers that pass you on the street . so these are my illusion glasses . they 're a little bigger . they 're a prototype . and when you look through them , you get a glimpse into the mind of the cyber - illusionist . let me show you what i mean . all we need is a playing card . any card will do . like this . and let me mark it so we can recognize it when we see it again . all right . very significant mark . and let 's put it back into the deck , somewhere in the middle , and let 's get started . voice : system ready . acquiring image . marco tempest : for those of you who do n't play cards , a deck of cards is made up of four different suits : hearts , clubs , diamonds and spades . the cards are amongst the oldest of symbols , and have been interpreted in many different ways . now , some say that the four suits represent the four seasons . there 's spring , summer , autumn and â   voice : my favorite season is winter . mt : well yeah , mine too . winter is like magic . it 's a time of change , when warmth turns to cold , water turns to snow , and then it all disappears . there are 13 cards in each suit . voice : each card represents a phase of the 13 lunar cycles . mt : so over here is low tide , and over here is high tide , and in the middle is the moon . voice : the moon is one of the most potent symbols of magic . mt : there are two colors in a deck of cards . there is the color red and the color black , representing the constant change from day to night . voice : marco , i did not know you could do that . mt : and is it a coincidence that there are 52 cards in a deck of cards , just as there are 52 weeks in a year ? voice : if you total all the spots on a deck of cards , the result is 365 . mt : oh , 365 , the number of days in a year , the number of days between each birthday . make a wish . voice : do n't tell , or it wo n't come true . mt : well , as a matter of fact , it was on my sixth birthday that i received my first deck of cards , and ever since that day , i have traveled around the world performing magic for boys and girls , men and women , husbands and wives , even kings and queens . voice : and who are these ? mt : ah , mischief - makers . watch . wake up . joker : whoa . mt : are you ready for your party piece ? joker : ready ! mt : let me see what you 've got . joker : presenting my pogo stick . mt : ah . watch out . joker : whoa , whoa , whoa , oh ! mt : but today , i am performing for a different kind of audience . i 'm performing for you . voice : signed card detected . mt : well , sometimes people ask me how do you become a magician ? is it a 9 - to - 5 job ? of course not ! you 've got to practice 24/7 . i do n't literally mean 24 hours , seven days a week . 24/7 is a little bit of an exaggeration , but it does take practice . now , some people will say , well , magic , that must be the work of some evil supernatural force . whoa . well , to this , i just say , no no. actually , in german , it 's nein nein . magic is n't that intense . i have to warn you , though , if you ever play with someone who deals cards like this , do n't play for money . voice : why not ? that 's a very good hand . the odds of getting it are 4,165 to one . mt : yeah , but i guess my hand is better . we beat the odds . voice : i think you got your birthday wish . mt : and that actually leaves me with the last , and most important card of all : the one with this very significant mark on it . and unlike anything else we 've just seen , virtual or not . voice : signed card detected . digital mt : this is without a question the real thing . mt : bye bye . thank you . thank you very much .
biology technology	now , extinction is a different kind of death . it 's bigger . we did n't really realize that until 1914 , when the last passenger pigeon , a female named martha , died at the cincinnati zoo . this had been the most abundant bird in the world that 'd been in north america for six million years . suddenly it was n't here at all . flocks that were a mile wide and 400 miles long used to darken the sun. aldo leopold said this was a biological storm , a feathered tempest . and indeed it was a keystone species that enriched the entire eastern deciduous forest , from the mississippi to the atlantic , from canada down to the gulf . but it went from five billion birds to zero in just a couple decades . what happened ? well , commercial hunting happened . these birds were hunted for meat that was sold by the ton , and it was easy to do because when those big flocks came down to the ground , they were so dense that hundreds of hunters and netters could show up and slaughter them by the tens of thousands . it was the cheapest source of protein in america . by the end of the century , there was nothing left but these beautiful skins in museum specimen drawers . there 's an upside to the story . this made people realize that the same thing was about to happen to the american bison , and so these birds saved the buffalos . but a lot of other animals were n't saved . the carolina parakeet was a parrot that lit up backyards everywhere . it was hunted to death for its feathers . there was a bird that people liked on the east coast called the heath hen . it was loved . they tried to protect it . it died anyway . a local newspaper spelled out , " there is no survivor , there is no future , there is no life to be recreated in this form ever again . " there 's a sense of deep tragedy that goes with these things , and it happened to lots of birds that people loved . it happened to lots of mammals . another keystone species is a famous animal called the european aurochs . there was sort of a movie made about it recently . and the aurochs was like the bison . this was an animal that basically kept the forest mixed with grasslands across the entire europe and asian continent , from spain to korea . the documentation of this animal goes back to the lascaux cave paintings . the extinctions still go on . there 's an ibex in spain called the bucardo . it went extinct in 2000 . there was a marvelous animal , a marsupial wolf called the thylacine in tasmania , south of australia , called the tasmanian tiger . it was hunted until there were just a few left to die in zoos . a little bit of film was shot . sorrow , anger , mourning . do n't mourn . organize . what if you could find out that , using the dna in museum specimens , fossils maybe up to 200,000 years old could be used to bring species back , what would you do ? where would you start ? well , you 'd start by finding out if the biotech is really there . i started with my wife , ryan phelan , who ran a biotech business called dna direct , and through her , one of her colleagues , george church , one of the leading genetic engineers who turned out to be also obsessed with passenger pigeons and a lot of confidence that methodologies he was working on might actually do the deed . so he and ryan organized and hosted a meeting at the wyss institute in harvard bringing together specialists on passenger pigeons , conservation ornithologists , bioethicists , and fortunately passenger pigeon dna had already been sequenced by a molecular biologist named beth shapiro . all she needed from those specimens at the smithsonian was a little bit of toe pad tissue , because down in there is what is called ancient dna . it 's dna which is pretty badly fragmented , but with good techniques now , you can basically reassemble the whole genome . then the question is , can you reassemble , with that genome , the whole bird ? george church thinks you can . so in his book , " regenesis , " which i recommend , he has a chapter on the science of bringing back extinct species , and he has a machine called the multiplex automated genome engineering machine . it 's kind of like an evolution machine . you try combinations of genes that you write at the cell level and then in organs on a chip , and the ones that win , that you can then put into a living organism . it 'll work . the precision of this , one of george 's famous unreadable slides , nevertheless points out that there 's a level of precision here right down to the individual base pair . the passenger pigeon has 1.3 billion base pairs in its genome . so what you 're getting is the capability now of replacing one gene with another variation of that gene . it 's called an allele . well that 's what happens in normal hybridization anyway . so this is a form of synthetic hybridization of the genome of an extinct species with the genome of its closest living relative . now along the way , george points out that his technology , the technology of synthetic biology , is currently accelerating at four times the rate of moore 's law . it 's been doing that since 2005 , and it 's likely to continue . okay , the closest living relative of the passenger pigeon is the band - tailed pigeon . they 're abundant . there 's some around here . genetically , the band - tailed pigeon already is mostly living passenger pigeon . there 's just some bits that are band - tailed pigeon . if you replace those bits with passenger pigeon bits , you 've got the extinct bird back , cooing at you . now , there 's work to do . you have to figure out exactly what genes matter . so there 's genes for the short tail in the band - tailed pigeon , genes for the long tail in the passenger pigeon , and so on with the red eye , peach - colored breast , flocking , and so on . add them all up and the result wo n't be perfect . but it should be be perfect enough , because nature does n't do perfect either . so this meeting in boston led to three things . first off , ryan and i decided to create a nonprofit called revive and restore that would push de - extinction generally and try to have it go in a responsible way , and we would push ahead with the passenger pigeon . another direct result was a young grad student named ben novak , who had been obsessed with passenger pigeons since he was 14 and had also learned how to work with ancient dna , himself sequenced the passenger pigeon , using money from his family and friends . we hired him full - time . now , this photograph i took of him last year at the smithsonian , he 's looking down at martha , the last passenger pigeon alive . so if he 's successful , she wo n't be the last . the third result of the boston meeting was the realization that there are scientists all over the world working on various forms of de - extinction , but they 'd never met each other . and national geographic got interested because national geographic has the theory that the last century , discovery was basically finding things , and in this century , discovery is basically making things . de - extinction falls in that category . so they hosted and funded this meeting . and 35 scientists , they were conservation biologists and molecular biologists , basically meeting to see if they had work to do together . some of these conservation biologists are pretty radical . there 's three of them who are not just re - creating ancient species , they 're recreating extinct ecosystems in northern siberia , in the netherlands , and in hawaii . henri , from the netherlands , with a dutch last name i wo n't try to pronounce , is working on the aurochs . the aurochs is the ancestor of all domestic cattle , and so basically its genome is alive , it 's just unevenly distributed . so what they 're doing is working with seven breeds of primitive , hardy - looking cattle like that maremmana primitivo on the top there to rebuild , over time , with selective back - breeding , the aurochs . now , re - wilding is moving faster in korea than it is in america , and so the plan is , with these re - wilded areas all over europe , they will introduce the aurochs to do its old job , its old ecological role , of clearing the somewhat barren , closed - canopy forest so that it has these biodiverse meadows in it . another amazing story came from alberto fernández - arias . alberto worked with the bucardo in spain . the last bucardo was a female named celia who was still alive , but then they captured her , they got a little bit of tissue from her ear , they cryopreserved it in liquid nitrogen , released her back into the wild , but a few months later , she was found dead under a fallen tree . they took the dna from that ear , they planted it as a cloned egg in a goat , the pregnancy came to term , and a live baby bucardo was born . it was the first de - extinction in history . it was short - lived . sometimes interspecies clones have respiration problems . this one had a malformed lung and died after 10 minutes , but alberto was confident that cloning has moved along well since then , and this will move ahead , and eventually there will be a population of bucardos back in the mountains in northern spain . cryopreservation pioneer of great depth is oliver ryder . at the san diego zoo , his frozen zoo has collected the tissues from over 1,000 species over the last 35 years . now , when it 's frozen that deep , minus 196 degrees celsius , the cells are intact and the dna is intact . they 're basically viable cells , so someone like bob lanza at advanced cell technology took some of that tissue from an endangered animal called the javan banteng , put it in a cow , the cow went to term , and what was born was a live , healthy baby javan banteng , who thrived and is still alive . the most exciting thing for bob lanza is the ability now to take any kind of cell with induced pluripotent stem cells and turn it into germ cells , like sperm and eggs . so now we go to mike mcgrew who is a scientist at roslin institute in scotland , and mike 's doing miracles with birds . so he 'll take , say , falcon skin cells , fibroblast , turn it into induced pluripotent stem cells . since it 's so pluripotent , it can become germ plasm . he then has a way to put the germ plasm into the embryo of a chicken egg so that that chicken will have , basically , the gonads of a falcon . you get a male and a female each of those , and out of them comes falcons . real falcons out of slightly doctored chickens . ben novak was the youngest scientist at the meeting . he showed how all of this can be put together . the sequence of events : he 'll put together the genomes of the band - tailed pigeon and the passenger pigeon , he 'll take the techniques of george church and get passenger pigeon dna , the techniques of robert lanza and michael mcgrew , get that dna into chicken gonads , and out of the chicken gonads get passenger pigeon eggs , squabs , and now you 're getting a population of passenger pigeons . it does raise the question of , they 're not going to have passenger pigeon parents to teach them how to be a passenger pigeon . so what do you do about that ? well birds are pretty hard - wired , as it happens , so most of that is already in their dna , but to supplement it , part of ben 's idea is to use homing pigeons to help train the young passenger pigeons how to flock and how to find their way to their old nesting grounds and feeding grounds . there were some conservationists , really famous conservationists like stanley temple , who is one of the founders of conservation biology , and kate jones from the iucn , which does the red list . they 're excited about all this , but they 're also concerned that it might be competitive with the extremely important efforts to protect endangered species that are still alive , that have n't gone extinct yet . you see , you want to work on protecting the animals out there . you want to work on getting the market for ivory in asia down so you 're not using 25,000 elephants a year . but at the same time , conservation biologists are realizing that bad news bums people out . and so the red list is really important , keep track of what 's endangered and critically endangered , and so on . but they 're about to create what they call a green list , and the green list will have species that are doing fine , thank you , species that were endangered , like the bald eagle , but they 're much better off now , thanks to everybody 's good work , and protected areas around the world that are very , very well managed . so basically , they 're learning how to build on good news . and they see reviving extinct species as the kind of good news you might be able to build on . here 's a couple related examples . captive breeding will be a major part of bringing back these species . the california condor was down to 22 birds in 1987 . everybody thought is was finished . thanks to captive breeding at the san diego zoo , there 's 405 of them now , 226 are out in the wild . that technology will be used on de - extincted animals . another success story is the mountain gorilla in central africa . in 1981 , dian fossey was sure they were going extinct . there were just 254 left . now there are 880. they 're increasing in population by three percent a year . the secret is , they have an eco - tourism program , which is absolutely brilliant . so this photograph was taken last month by ryan with an iphone . that 's how comfortable these wild gorillas are with visitors . another interesting project , though it 's going to need some help , is the northern white rhinoceros . there 's no breeding pairs left . but this is the kind of thing that a wide variety of dna for this animal is available in the frozen zoo . a bit of cloning , you can get them back . so where do we go from here ? these have been private meetings so far . i think it 's time for the subject to go public . what do people think about it ? you know , do you want extinct species back ? do you want extinct species back ? tinker bell is going to come fluttering down . it is a tinker bell moment , because what are people excited about with this ? what are they concerned about ? we 're also going to push ahead with the passenger pigeon . so ben novak , even as we speak , is joining the group that beth shapiro has at uc santa cruz . they 're going to work on the genomes of the passenger pigeon and the band - tailed pigeon . as that data matures , they 'll send it to george church , who will work his magic , get passenger pigeon dna out of that . we 'll get help from bob lanza and mike mcgrew to get that into germ plasm that can go into chickens that can produce passenger pigeon squabs that can be raised by band - tailed pigeon parents , and then from then on , it 's passenger pigeons all the way , maybe for the next six million years . you can do the same thing , as the costs come down , for the carolina parakeet , for the great auk , for the heath hen , for the ivory - billed woodpecker , for the eskimo curlew , for the caribbean monk seal , for the woolly mammoth . because the fact is , humans have made a huge hole in nature in the last 10,000 years . we have the ability now , and maybe the moral obligation , to repair some of the damage . most of that we 'll do by expanding and protecting wildlands , by expanding and protecting the populations of endangered species . but some species that we killed off totally we could consider bringing back to a world that misses them . thank you . chris anderson : thank you . i 've got a question . so , this is an emotional topic . some people stand . i suspect there are some people out there sitting , kind of asking tormented questions , almost , about , well , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait a minute , there 's something wrong with mankind interfering in nature in this way . there 's going to be unintended consequences . you 're going to uncork some sort of pandora 's box of who - knows - what . do they have a point ? stewart brand : well , the earlier point is we interfered in a big way by making these animals go extinct , and many of them were keystone species , and we changed the whole ecosystem they were in by letting them go . now , there 's the shifting baseline problem , which is , so when these things come back , they might replace some birds that are there that people really know and love . i think that 's , you know , part of how it 'll work . this is a long , slow process -- one of the things i like about it , it 's multi - generation . we will get woolly mammoths back . ca : well it feels like both the conversation and the potential here are pretty thrilling . thank you so much for presenting . sb : thank you . ca : thank you .
science	so raise your hand if you know someone in your immediate family or circle of friends who suffers from some form of mental illness . yeah . i thought so . not surprised . and raise your hand if you think that basic research on fruit flies has anything to do with understanding mental illness in humans . yeah . i thought so . i 'm also not surprised . i can see i 've got my work cut out for me here . as we heard from dr. insel this morning , psychiatric disorders like autism , depression and schizophrenia take a terrible toll on human suffering . we know much less about their treatment and the understanding of their basic mechanisms than we do about diseases of the body . think about it : in 2013 , the second decade of the millennium , if you 're concerned about a cancer diagnosis and you go to your doctor , you get bone scans , biopsies and blood tests . in 2013 , if you 're concerned about a depression diagnosis , you go to your doctor , and what do you get ? a questionnaire . now , part of the reason for this is that we have an oversimplified and increasingly outmoded view of the biological basis of psychiatric disorders . we tend to view them -- and the popular press aids and abets this view -- as chemical imbalances in the brain , as if the brain were some kind of bag of chemical soup full of dopamine , serotonin and norepinephrine . this view is conditioned by the fact that many of the drugs that are prescribed to treat these disorders , like prozac , act by globally changing brain chemistry , as if the brain were indeed a bag of chemical soup . but that ca n't be the answer , because these drugs actually do n't work all that well . a lot of people wo n't take them , or stop taking them , because of their unpleasant side effects . these drugs have so many side effects because using them to treat a complex psychiatric disorder is a bit like trying to change your engine oil by opening a can and pouring it all over the engine block . some of it will dribble into the right place , but a lot of it will do more harm than good . now , an emerging view that you also heard about from dr. insel this morning , is that psychiatric disorders are actually disturbances of neural circuits that mediate emotion , mood and affect . when we think about cognition , we analogize the brain to a computer . that 's no problem . well it turns out that the computer analogy is just as valid for emotion . it 's just that we do n't tend to think about it that way . but we know much less about the circuit basis of psychiatric disorders because of the overwhelming dominance of this chemical imbalance hypothesis . now , it 's not that chemicals are not important in psychiatric disorders . it 's just that they do n't bathe the brain like soup . rather , they 're released in very specific locations and they act on specific synapses to change the flow of information in the brain . so if we ever really want to understand the biological basis of psychiatric disorders , we need to pinpoint these locations in the brain where these chemicals act . otherwise , we 're going to keep pouring oil all over our mental engines and suffering the consequences . now to begin to overcome our ignorance of the role of brain chemistry in brain circuitry , it 's helpful to work on what we biologists call " model organisms , " animals like fruit flies and laboratory mice , in which we can apply powerful genetic techniques to molecularly identify and pinpoint specific classes of neurons , as you heard about in allan jones 's talk this morning . moreover , once we can do that , we can actually activate specific neurons or we can destroy or inhibit the activity of those neurons . so if we inhibit a particular type of neuron , and we find that a behavior is blocked , we can conclude that those neurons are necessary for that behavior . on the other hand , if we activate a group of neurons and we find that that produces the behavior , we can conclude that those neurons are sufficient for the behavior . so in this way , by doing this kind of test , we can draw cause and effect relationships between the activity of specific neurons in particular circuits and particular behaviors , something that is extremely difficult , if not impossible , to do right now in humans . but can an organism like a fruit fly , which is -- it 's a great model organism because it 's got a small brain , it 's capable of complex and sophisticated behaviors , it breeds quickly , and it 's cheap . but can an organism like this teach us anything about emotion - like states ? do these organisms even have emotion - like states , or are they just little digital robots ? charles darwin believed that insects have emotion and express them in their behaviors , as he wrote in his 1872 monograph on the expression of the emotions in man and animals . and my eponymous colleague , seymour benzer , believed it as well . seymour is the man that introduced the use of drosophila here at caltech in the '60s as a model organism to study the connection between genes and behavior . seymour recruited me to caltech in the late 1980s . he was my jedi and my rabbi while he was here , and seymour taught me both to love flies and also to play with science . so how do we ask this question ? it 's one thing to believe that flies have emotion - like states , but how do we actually find out whether that 's true or not ? now , in humans we often infer emotional states , as you 'll hear later today , from facial expressions . however , it 's a little difficult to do that in fruit flies . it 's kind of like landing on mars and looking out the window of your spaceship at all the little green men who are surrounding it and trying to figure out , " how do i find out if they have emotions or not ? " what can we do ? it 's not so easy . well , one of the ways that we can start is to try to come up with some general characteristics or properties of emotion - like states such as arousal , and see if we can identify any fly behaviors that might exhibit some of those properties . so three important ones that i can think of are persistence , gradations in intensity , and valence . persistence means long - lasting . we all know that the stimulus that triggers an emotion causes that emotion to last long after the stimulus is gone . gradations of intensity means what it sounds like . you can dial up the intensity or dial down the intensity of an emotion . if you 're a little bit unhappy , the corners of your mouth turn down and you sniffle , and if you 're very unhappy , tears pour down your face and you might sob . valence means good or bad , positive or negative . so we decided to see if flies could be provoked into showing the kind of behavior that you see by the proverbial wasp at the picnic table , you know , the one that keeps coming back to your hamburger the more vigorously you try to swat it away , and it seems to keep getting irritated . so we built a device , which we call a puff - o - mat , in which we could deliver little brief air puffs to fruit flies in these plastic tubes in our laboratory bench and blow them away . and what we found is that if we gave these flies in the puff - o - mat several puffs in a row , they became somewhat hyperactive and continued to run around for some time after the air puffs actually stopped and took a while to calm down . so we quantified this behavior using custom locomotor tracking software developed with my collaborator pietro perona , who 's in the electrical engineering division here at caltech . and what this quantification showed us is that , upon experiencing a train of these air puffs , the flies appear to enter a kind of state of hyperactivity which is persistent , long - lasting , and also appears to be graded . more puffs , or more intense puffs , make the state last for a longer period of time . so now we wanted to try to understand something about what controls the duration of this state . so we decided to use our puff - o - mat and our automated tracking software to screen through hundreds of lines of mutant fruit flies to see if we could find any that showed abnormal responses to the air puffs . and this is one of the great things about fruit flies . there are repositories where you can just pick up the phone and order hundreds of vials of flies of different mutants and screen them in your assay and then find out what gene is affected in the mutation . so doing the screen , we discovered one mutant that took much longer than normal to calm down after the air puffs , and when we examined the gene that was affected in this mutation , it turned out to encode a dopamine receptor . that 's right -- flies , like people , have dopamine , and it acts on their brains and on their synapses through the same dopamine receptor molecules that you and i have . dopamine plays a number of important functions in the brain , including in attention , arousal , reward , and disorders of the dopamine system have been linked to a number of mental disorders including drug abuse , parkinson 's disease , and adhd . now , in genetics , it 's a little counterintuitive . we tend to infer the normal function of something by what does n't happen when we take it away , by the opposite of what we see when we take it away . so when we take away the dopamine receptor and the flies take longer to calm down , from that we infer that the normal function of this receptor and dopamine is to cause the flies to calm down faster after the puff . and that 's a bit reminiscent of adhd , which has been linked to disorders of the dopamine system in humans . indeed , if we increase the levels of dopamine in normal flies by feeding them cocaine after getting the appropriate dea license -- oh my god -- -- we find indeed that these cocaine - fed flies calm down faster than normal flies do , and that 's also reminiscent of adhd , which is often treated with drugs like ritalin that act similarly to cocaine . so slowly i began to realize that what started out as a rather playful attempt to try to annoy fruit flies might actually have some relevance to a human psychiatric disorder . now , how far does this analogy go ? as many of you know , individuals afflicted with adhd also have learning disabilities . is that true of our dopamine receptor mutant flies ? remarkably , the answer is yes . as seymour showed back in the 1970s , flies , like songbirds , as you just heard , are capable of learning . you can train a fly to avoid an odor , shown here in blue , if you pair that odor with a shock . then when you give those trained flies the chance to choose between a tube with the shock - paired odor and another odor , it avoids the tube containing the blue odor that was paired with shock . well , if you do this test on dopamine receptor mutant flies , they do n't learn . their learning score is zero . they flunk out of caltech . so that means that these flies have two abnormalities , or phenotypes , as we geneticists call them , that one finds in adhd : hyperactivity and learning disability . now what 's the causal relationship , if anything , between these phenotypes ? in adhd , it 's often assumed that the hyperactivity causes the learning disability . the kids ca n't sit still long enough to focus , so they do n't learn . but it could equally be the case that it 's the learning disabilities that cause the hyperactivity . because the kids ca n't learn , they look for other things to distract their attention . and a final possibility is that there 's no relationship at all between learning disabilities and hyperactivity , but that they are caused by a common underlying mechanism in adhd . now people have been wondering about this for a long time in humans , but in flies we can actually test this . and the way that we do this is to delve deeply into the mind of the fly and begin to untangle its circuitry using genetics . we take our dopamine receptor mutant flies and we genetically restore , or cure , the dopamine receptor by putting a good copy of the dopamine receptor gene back into the fly brain . but in each fly , we put it back only into certain neurons and not in others , and then we test each of these flies for their ability to learn and for hyperactivity . remarkably , we find we can completely dissociate these two abnormalities . if we put a good copy of the dopamine receptor back in this elliptical structure called the central complex , the flies are no longer hyperactive , but they still ca n't learn . on the other hand , if we put the receptor back in a different structure called the mushroom body , the learning deficit is rescued , the flies learn well , but they 're still hyperactive . what that tells us is that dopamine is not bathing the brain of these flies like soup . rather , it 's acting to control two different functions on two different circuits , so the reason there are two things wrong with our dopamine receptor flies is that the same receptor is controlling two different functions in two different regions of the brain . whether the same thing is true in adhd in humans we do n't know , but these kinds of results should at least cause us to consider that possibility . so these results make me and my colleagues more convinced than ever that the brain is not a bag of chemical soup , and it 's a mistake to try to treat complex psychiatric disorders just by changing the flavor of the soup . what we need to do is to use our ingenuity and our scientific knowledge to try to design a new generation of treatments that are targeted to specific neurons and specific regions of the brain that are affected in particular psychiatric disorders . if we can do that , we may be able to cure these disorders without the unpleasant side effects , putting the oil back in our mental engines , just where it 's needed . thank you very much .
business	b.j. was one of many fellow inmates who had big plans for the future . he had a vision . when he got out , he was going to leave the dope game for good and fly straight , and he was actually working on merging his two passions into one vision . he 'd spent 10,000 dollars to buy a website that exclusively featured women having sex on top of or inside of luxury sports cars . it was my first week in federal prison , and i was learning quickly that it was n't what you see on tv . in fact , it was teeming with smart , ambitious men whose business instincts were in many cases as sharp as those of the ceos who had wined and dined me six months earlier when i was a rising star in the missouri senate . now , 95 percent of the guys that i was locked up with had been drug dealers on the outside , but when they talked about what they did , they talked about it in a different jargon , but the business concepts that they talked about were n't unlike those that you 'd learn in a first year mba class at wharton : promotional incentives , you never charge a first - time user , focus - grouping new product launches , territorial expansion . but they did n't spend a lot of time reliving the glory days . for the most part , everyone was just trying to survive . it 's a lot harder than you might think . contrary to what most people think , people do n't pay , taxpayers do n't pay , for your life when you 're in prison . you 've got to pay for your own life . you 've got to pay for your soap , your deodorant , toothbrush , toothpaste , all of it . and it 's hard for a couple of reasons . first , everything 's marked up 30 to 50 percent from what you 'd pay on the street , and second , you do n't make a lot of money . i unloaded trucks . that was my full - time job , unloading trucks at a food warehouse , for $ 5.25 , not an hour , but per month . so how do you survive ? well , you learn to hustle , all kinds of hustles . there 's legal hustles . you pay everything in stamps . those are the currency . you charge another inmate to clean his cell . there 's sort of illegal hustles , like you run a barbershop out of your cell . there 's pretty illegal hustles : you run a tattoo parlor out of your own cell . and there 's very illegal hustles , which you smuggle in , you get smuggled in , drugs , pornography , cell phones , and just as in the outer world , there 's a risk - reward tradeoff , so the riskier the enterprise , the more profitable it can potentially be . you want a cigarette in prison ? three to five dollars . you want an old - fashioned cell phone that you flip open and is about as big as your head ? three hundred bucks . you want a dirty magazine ? well , it can be as much as 1,000 dollars . so as you can probably tell , one of the defining aspects of prison life is ingenuity . whether it was concocting delicious meals from stolen scraps from the warehouse , sculpting people 's hair with toenail clippers , or constructing weights from boulders in laundry bags tied on to tree limbs , prisoners learn how to make do with less , and many of them want to take this ingenuity that they 've learned to the outside and start restaurants , barber shops , personal training businesses . but there 's no training , nothing to prepare them for that , no rehabilitation at all in prison , no one to help them write a business plan , figure out a way to translate the business concepts they intuitively grasp into legal enterprises , no access to the internet , even . and then , when they come out , most states do n't even have a law prohibiting employers from discriminating against people with a background . so none of us should be surprised that two out of three ex - offenders re - offend within five years . look , i lied to the feds . i lost a year of my life from it . but when i came out , i vowed that i was going to do whatever i could to make sure that guys like the ones i was locked up with did n't have to waste any more of their life than they already had . so i hope that you 'll think about helping in some way . the best thing we can do is figure out ways to nurture the entrepreneurial spirit and the tremendous untapped potential in our prisons , because if we do n't , they 're not going to learn any new skills that 's going to help them , and they 'll be right back . all they 'll learn on the inside is new hustles . thank you .
science global	this man is wearing what we call a bee beard . a beard full of bees . now , this is what many of you might picture when you think about honeybees , maybe insects , or maybe anything that has more legs than two . and let me start by telling you , i gotcha . i understand that . but , there are many things to know , and i want you to open your minds here , keep them open , and change your perspective about honeybees . notice that this man is not getting stung . he probably has a queen bee tied to his chin , and the other bees are attracted to it . so this really demonstrates our relationship with honeybees , and that goes deep back for thousands of years . we 're very co - evolved , because we depend on bees for pollination and , even more recently , as an economic commodity . many of you may have heard that honeybees are disappearing , not just dying , but they 're gone . we do n't even find dead bodies . this is called colony collapse disorder , and it 's bizarre . researchers around the globe still do not know what 's causing it , but what we do know is that , with the declining numbers of bees , the costs of over 130 fruit and vegetable crops that we rely on for food is going up in price . so honeybees are important for their role in the economy as well as in agriculture . here you can see some pictures of what are called green roofs , or urban agriculture . we 're familiar with the image on the left that shows a local neighborhood garden in the south end . that 's where i call home . i have a beehive in the backyard . and perhaps a green roof in the future , when we 're further utilizing urban areas , where there are stacks of garden spaces . check out this image above the orange line in boston . try to spot the beehive . it 's there . it 's on the rooftop , right on the corner there , and it 's been there for a couple of years now . the way that urban beekeeping currently operates is that the beehives are quite hidden , and it 's not because they need to be . it 's just because people are uncomfortable with the idea , and that 's why i want you today to try to think about this , think about the benefits of bees in cities and why they really are a terrific thing . let me give you a brief rundown on how pollination works . so we know flowers , we know fruits and vegetables , even some alfalfa in hay that the livestock for the meats that we eat , rely on pollinators , but you 've got male and female parts to a plant here , and basically pollinators are attracted to plants for their nectar , and in the process , a bee will visit some flowers and pick up some pollen , or that male kind of sperm counterpart , along the way , and then travel to different flowers , and eventually an apple , in this case , will be produced . you can see the orientation . the stem is down . the blossom end has fallen off by the time we eat it , but that 's a basic overview of how pollination works . and let 's think about urban living , not today , and not in the past , but what about in a hundred years ? what 's it gonna look like ? we have huge grand challenges these days of habitat loss . we have more and more people , billions of people , in 100 years , god knows how many people , and how little space there will be to fit all of them , so we need to change the way that we see cities , and looking at this picture on the left of new york city today , you can see how gray and brown it is . we have tar paper on the rooftops that bounces heat back into the atmosphere , contributing to global climate change , no doubt . what about in 100 years , if we have green rooftops everywhere , and gardening , and we create our own crops right in the cities ? we save on the costs of transportation , we save on a healthier diet , and we also educate and create new jobs locally . we need bees for the future of our cities and urban living . here 's some data that we collected through our company with best bees , where we deliver , install and manage honeybee hives for anybody who wants them , in the city , in the countryside , and we introduce honeybees , and the idea of beekeeping in your own backyard or rooftop or fire escape , for even that matter , and seeing how simple it is and how possible it is . there 's a counterintuitive trend that we noticed in these numbers . so let 's look at the first metric here , overwintering survival . now this has been a huge problem for many years , basically since the late 1980s , when the varroa mite came and brought many different viruses , bacteria and fungal diseases with it . overwintering success is hard , and that 's when most of the colonies are lost , and we found that in the cities , bees are surviving better than they are in the country . a bit counterintuitive , right ? we think , oh , bees , countryside , agriculture , but that 's not what the bees are showing . the bees like it in the city . furthermore , they also produce more honey . the urban honey is delicious . the bees in boston on the rooftop of the seaport hotel , where we have hundreds of thousands of bees flying overheard right now that i 'm sure none of you noticed when we walked by , are going to all of the local community gardens and making delicious , healthy honey that just tastes like the flowers in our city . so the yield for urban hives , in terms of honey production , is higher as well as the overwintering survival , compared to rural areas . again , a bit counterintuitive . and looking back historically at the timeline of honeybee health , we can go back to the year 950 and see that there was also a great mortality of bees in ireland . so the problems of bees today is n't necessarily something new . it has been happening since over a thousand years ago , but what we do n't really notice are these problems in cities . so one thing i want to encourage you to think about is the idea of what an urban island is . you think in the city maybe the temperature 's warmer . why are bees doing better in the city ? this is a big question now to help us understand why they should be in the city . perhaps there 's more pollen in the city . with the trains coming in to urban hubs , they can carry pollen with them , very light pollen , and it 's just a big supermarket in the city . a lot of linden trees live along the railroad tracks . perhaps there are fewer pesticides in the cities than there are in urban areas . perhaps there are other things that we 're just not thinking about yet , but that 's one idea to think about , urban islands . and colony collapse disorder is not the only thing affecting honeybees . honeybees are dying , and it 's a huge , huge grand challenge of our time . what you can see up here is a map of the world , and we 're tracking the spread of this varroa mite . now , the varroa mite is what changed the game in beekeeping , and you can see , at the top right , the years are changing , we 're coming up to modern times , and you can see the spread of the varroa mite from the early 1900s through now . it 's 1968 , and we 're pretty much covering asia . 1971 , we saw it spread to europe and south america , and then , when we get to the 1980s , and specifically to 1987 , the varroa mite finally came to north america and to the united states , and that is when the game changed for honeybees in the united states . many of us will remember our childhood growing up , maybe you got stung by a bee , you saw bees on flowers . think of the kids today . their childhood 's a bit different . they do n't experience this . the bees just are n't around anymore . so we need bees and they 're disappearing and it 's a big problem . what can we do here ? so , what i do is honeybee research . i got my ph.d. studying honeybee health . i started in 2005 studying honeybees . in 2006 , honeybees started disappearing , so suddenly , like , this little nerd kid going to school working with bugs -- -- became very relevant in the world . and it worked out that way . so my research focuses on ways to make bees healthier . i do n't research what 's killing the bees , per se . i 'm not one of the many researchers around the world who 's looking at the effects of pesticides or diseases or habitat loss and poor nutrition on bees . we 're looking at ways to make bees healthier through vaccines , through yogurt , like probiotics , and other types of therapies in ways that can be fed orally to bees , and this process is so easy , even a 7 - year - old can do it . you just mix up some pollen , sugar and water , and whatever active ingredient you want to put in , and you just give it right to the bees . no chemicals involved , just immune boosters . humans think about our own health in a prospective way . we exercise , we eat healthy , we take vitamins . why do n't we think about honeybees in that same type of way ? bring them to areas where they 're thriving and try to make them healthier before they get sick . i spent many years in grad school trying to poke bees and do vaccines with needles . like , years , years at the bench , " oh my gosh , it 's 3 a.m. and i 'm still pricking bees . " and then one day i said , " why do n't we just do an oral vaccine ? " it 's like , " ugh , " so that 's what we do . i 'd love to share with you some images of urban beehives , because they can be anything . i mean , really open your mind with this . you can paint a hive to match your home . you can hide a hive inside your home . these are three hives on the rooftop of the fairmont copley plaza hotel , and they 're beautiful here . i mean , we matched the new color of the inside of their rooms to do some type of a stained wood with blue for their sheets , and these bees are terrific , and they also will use herbs that are growing in the garden . that 's what the chefs go to to use for their cooking , and the honey -- they do live events -- they 'll use that honey at their bars . honey is a great nutritional substitute for regular sugar because there are different types of sugars in there . we also have a classroom hives project , where -- this is a nonprofit venture -- we 're spreading the word around the world for how honeybee hives can be taken into the classroom or into the museum setting , behind glass , and used as an educational tool . this hive that you see here has been in fenway high school for many years now . the bees fly right into the outfield of fenway park . nobody notices it . if you 're not a flower , these bees do not care about you . they do n't . they do n't . they 'll say , " s'cuse me , flying around . " some other images here in telling a part of the story that really made urban beekeeping terrific is in new york city , beekeeping was illegal until 2010 . that 's a big problem , because what 's going to pollinate all of the gardens and the produce locally ? hands ? i mean , locally in boston , there is a terrific company called green city growers , and they are going and pollinating their squash crops by hand with q - tips , and if they miss that three day window , there 's no fruit . their clients are n't happy , and people go hungry . so this is important . we have also some images of honey from brooklyn . now , this was a mystery in the new york times where the honey was very red , and the new york state forensics department came in and they actually did some science to match the red dye with that found in a maraschino cherry factory down the street . so you can tailor your honey to taste however you want by planting bee - friendly flowers . paris has been a terrific model for urban beekeeping . they 've had hives on the rooftop of their opera house for many years now , and that 's what really got people started , thinking , " wow , we can do this , and we should do this . " also in london , and in europe across the board , they 're very advanced in their use of green rooftops and integrating beehives , and i 'll show you an ending note here . i would like to encourage you to open your mind . what can you do to save the bees or to help them or to think of sustainable cities in the future ? well , really , just change your perspective . try to understand that bees are very important . a bee is n't going to sting you if you see it . the bee dies . honeybees die when they sting , so they do n't want to do it either . it 's nothing to panic about . they 're all over the city . you could even get your own hive if you want . there are great resources available , and there are even companies that will help get you set up and mentor you and it 's important for our educational system in the world for students to learn about agriculture worldwide such as this little girl , who , again , is not even getting stung . thank you .
